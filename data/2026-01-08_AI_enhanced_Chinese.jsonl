However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation.

This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0VLM\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u5728\u5177\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5757\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1aVLM\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38VLA\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5173\u4e8eVLM\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VLM4VLA\u6700\u5c0f\u9002\u5e94\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5c06\u901a\u7528VLM\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aVLA\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e03\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u4f53\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "VLM\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46VLM\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002\u6539\u5584VLM\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4f53\u73b0\u6280\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5757\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5411VLM\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6ce8\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u5173\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6VLM\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u4f53\u73b0\u63a7\u5236\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u4f46\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u7684\uff0c\u5f53\u524dVLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u4f53\u73b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5757\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u4ef6\u662fVLA\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution.

Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models.

A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u71673D\u9ad8\u65af\u4eba\u5934\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700OLAT\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u6216\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u5934\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4e3b\u4f53\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u7167\u660e\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982OLAT\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4ece\u666e\u901a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u65e0OLAT\u7167\u660e\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e73\u51493DGS\u5934\u50cf\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5149\u7167\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21OLAT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u5e73\u5149\u5934\u50cf\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5934\u50cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u5373\u53ef\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u9896\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5934\u50cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700OLAT\u6570\u636e\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u71673D\u9ad8\u65af\u4eba\u5934\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5934\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing UAV navigation approaches rely on simplified simulators and supervised perception pipelines, and lack embodied agents interacting with physically realistic fire environments. We introduce FIRE-VLM, the first end-to-end vision-language model (VLM) guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework trained entirely within a high-fidelity, physics-grounded wildfire digital twin. Built from USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM) terrain, LANDFIRE fuel inventories, and semi-physical fire-spread solvers, this twin captures terrain-induced runs, wind-driven acceleration, smoke plume occlusion, and dynamic fuel consumption. Within this environment, a PPO agent with dual-view UAV sensing is guided by a CLIP-style VLM. Wildfire-specific semantic alignment scores, derived from a single prompt describing active fire and smoke plumes, are integrated as potential-based reward shaping signals. Our contributions are: (1) a GIS-to-simulation pipeline for constructing wildfire digital twins; (2) a VLM-guided RL agent for UAV firefront tracking; and (3) a wildfire-aware reward design that combines physical terms with VLM semantics. Across five digital-twin evaluation tasks, our VLM-guided policy reduces time-to-detection by up to 6 times, increases time-in-FOV, and is, to our knowledge, the first RL-based UAV wildfire monitoring system demonstrated in kilometer-scale, physics-grounded digital-twin fires.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIRE-VLM\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u91ce\u706b\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u4e3b\u706b\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u91ce\u706b\u76d1\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u706b\u707e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8eUSGS\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5730\u5f62\u3001LANDFIRE\u71c3\u6599\u6e05\u5355\u548c\u534a\u7269\u7406\u706b\u52bf\u8513\u5ef6\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91ce\u706b\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528PPO\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u914d\u5408\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f20\u611f\uff0c\u7531CLIP\u98ce\u683c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u63cf\u8ff0\u6d3b\u8dc3\u706b\u52bf\u548c\u70df\u96fe\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u91ce\u706b\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u52bf\u80fd\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cVLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u500d\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u89c6\u573a\u505c\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u5343\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u706b\u707e\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u91ce\u706b\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "FIRE-VLM\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u91ce\u706b\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u706b\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, traditional approaches exhibit limited adaptability in dynamic environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes OFF-EMMA, a novel end-to-end multimodal framework designed to overcome the deficiencies of insufficient spatial perception and unstable reasoning in visual-language-action (VLA) models for off-road autonomous driving scenarios. The framework explicitly annotates input images through the design of a visual prompt block and introduces a chain-of-thought with self-consistency (COT-SC) reasoning strategy to enhance the accuracy and robustness of trajectory planning. The visual prompt block utilizes semantic segmentation masks as visual prompts, enhancing the spatial understanding ability of pre-trained visual-language models for complex terrains. The COT- SC strategy effectively mitigates the error impact of outliers on planning performance through a multi-path reasoning mechanism. Experimental results on the RELLIS-3D off-road dataset demonstrate that OFF-EMMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the average L2 error of the Qwen backbone model by 13.3% and decreasing the failure rate from 16.52% to 6.56%.", "AI": {"tldr": "OFF-EMMA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5757\u548c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u81ea\u6d3d\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8d8a\u91ce\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d8a\u91ce\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d8a\u91ce\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u81ea\u6d3d\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u51cf\u5c11\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5bf9\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728RELLIS-3D\u8d8a\u91ce\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cOFF-EMMA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06Qwen\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747L2\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8613.3%\uff0c\u6545\u969c\u7387\u4ece16.52%\u964d\u81f36.56%\u3002", "conclusion": "OFF-EMMA\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u81ea\u6d3d\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d8a\u91ce\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Performance of string instruments, such as violin and cello, presents a significant challenge due to the precise control required over bow angle and pressure to produce the desired sound. While prior robotic cellists focus on accurate bowing trajectories, these works often rely on expensive motion capture techniques, and fail to sightread music in a human-like way.\n  We propose a novel end-to-end MIDI score to robotic motion pipeline which converts musical input directly into collision-aware bowing motions for a UR5e robot cellist. Through use of Universal Robot Freedrive feature, our robotic musician can achieve human-like sound without the need for motion capture. Additionally, this work records live joint data via Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE) as the robot plays, providing labeled robotic playing data from a collection of five standard pieces to the research community. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to human performers, we introduce the Musical Turing Test, in which a collection of 132 human participants evaluate our robot's performance against a human baseline. Human reference recordings are also released, enabling direct comparison for future studies. This evaluation technique establishes the first benchmark for robotic cello performance. Finally, we outline a residual reinforcement learning methodology to improve upon baseline robotic controls, highlighting future opportunities for improved string-crossing efficiency and sound quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aefMIDI\u4e50\u8c31\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528UR5e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u5927\u63d0\u7434\u6f14\u594f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RTDE\u8bb0\u5f55\u6f14\u594f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u97f3\u4e50\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f26\u4e50\u6f14\u594f\u8005\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5f13\u6cd5\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u89c6\u594f\u97f3\u4e50\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u594f\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aefMIDI\u4e50\u8c31\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u6362\u97f3\u4e50\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a\u78b0\u649e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f13\u6cd5\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528Universal Robot\u7684Freedrive\u529f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u58f0\u97f3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7RTDE\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bb0\u5f55\u5173\u8282\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6536\u96c65\u9996\u6807\u51c6\u66f2\u76ee\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6f14\u594f\u6570\u636e\uff1b4) \u5f15\u5165\u97f3\u4e50\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8ba9132\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u594f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4", "result": "1) \u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u594f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b2) \u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u594f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u4e50\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u594f\u7684\u7c7b\u4eba\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b4) \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5927\u63d0\u7434\u6f14\u594f\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f26\u4e50\u6f14\u594f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u6280\u672f\u3002\u97f3\u4e50\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u97f3\u4e50\u8868\u6f14\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u5f26\u4ea4\u53c9\u6548\u7387\u548c\u97f3\u8d28"}}

This paper introduces Locomotion Beyond Feet, a comprehensive system for whole-body humanoid locomotion across extremely challenging terrains, including low-clearance spaces under chairs, knee-high walls, knee-high platforms, and steep ascending and descending stairs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: contact-rich motion planning and generalization across diverse terrains. To this end, we combine physics-grounded keyframe animation with reinforcement learning. Keyframes encode human knowledge of motor skills, are embodiment-specific, and can be readily validated in simulation or on hardware, while reinforcement learning transforms these references into robust, physically accurate motions. We further employ a hierarchical framework consisting of terrain-specific motion-tracking policies, failure recovery mechanisms, and a vision-based skill planner.

We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference.

We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "GAMBIT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8d8a\u72f1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u89e3\u91cd\u7ec4\u4e3a\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u91cd\u6784\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u589e\u52a0\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u80fd\u5426\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u8d8a\u72f1\uff1f", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGAMBIT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5206\u89e3\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u6709\u5bb3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efa\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b3) \u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6784\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d62\u5f97\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u589e\u52a0\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u975e\u63a8\u7406MLLMs\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGAMBIT\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1aGemini 2.5 Flash\u8fbe92.13%\uff0cQvQ-MAX\u8fbe91.20%\uff0cGPT-4o\u8fbe85.87%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0cGAMBIT\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u8d8a\u72f1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Ege de Bruin", "Kyrre Glette", "Kai Olav Ellefsen"], "title": "Generational Replacement and Learning for High-Performing and Diverse Populations in Evolvable Robots", "comment": null, "summary": "Evolutionary Robotics offers the possibility to design robots to solve a specific task automatically by optimizing their morphology and control together. However, this co-optimization of body and control is challenging, because controllers need some time to adapt to the evolving morphology - which may make it difficult for new and promising designs to enter the evolving population. A solution to this is to add intra-life learning, defined as an additional controller optimization loop, to each individual in the evolving population. A related problem is the lack of diversity often seen in evolving populations as evolution narrows the search down to a few promising designs too quickly. This problem can be mitigated by implementing full generational replacement, where offspring robots replace the whole population. This solution for increasing diversity usually comes at the cost of lower performance compared to using elitism. In this work, we show that combining such generational replacement with intra-life learning can increase diversity while retaining performance. We also highlight the importance of performance metrics when studying learning in morphologically evolving robots, showing that evaluating according to function evaluations versus according to generations of evolution can give different conclusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u9645\u66ff\u6362\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u79cd\u7fa4\u591a\u6837\u6027", "motivation": "\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e2d\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u95f4\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u5165\u79cd\u7fa4\uff1b2\uff09\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e38\u56e0\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5982\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u524d\u8005\uff0c\u800c\u4ee3\u9645\u66ff\u6362\u53ef\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4ee3\u9645\u66ff\u6362\uff08\u6bcf\u4ee3\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u6362\u6574\u4e2a\u79cd\u7fa4\uff09\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u989d\u5916\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff09\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5f62\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570 vs \u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u6570\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u9645\u66ff\u6362\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u79cd\u7fa4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u6839\u636e\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f97\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u9645\u66ff\u6362\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e2d\u5f62\u6001-\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53c8\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f62\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

This creates a body-brain optimization problem, where both morphology and control must be optimized together. A common approach is to include controller optimization for each morphology, but starting from scratch for every new body may require a high controller learning budget. We address this by using Bayesian optimization for controller optimization, exploiting its sample efficiency and strong exploration capabilities, and using sample inheritance as a form of Lamarckian inheritance. Under a deliberately low controller learning budget for each morphology, we investigate two types of sample inheritance: (1) transferring all the parent's samples to the offspring to be used as prior without evaluating them, and (2) reevaluating the parent's best samples on the offspring. Both are compared to a baseline without inheritance. Our results show that reevaluation performs best, with prior-based inheritance also outperforming no inheritance. Analysis reveals that while the learning budget is too low for a single morphology, generational inheritance compensates for this by accumulating learned adaptations across generations. Furthermore, inheritance mainly benefits offspring morphologies that are similar to their parents. Finally, we demonstrate the critical role of the environment, with more challenging environments resulting in more stable walking gaits. Our findings highlight that inheritance mechanisms can boost performance in evolutionary robotics without needing large learning budgets, offering an efficient path toward more capable robot design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7ee7\u627f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7236\u4ee3\u6700\u4f73\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8eab\u4f53-\u5927\u8111\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u5f62\u6001\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u4f4e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u6837\u672c\u7ee7\u627f\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1a1) \u5c06\u7236\u4ee3\u6240\u6709\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7ed9\u540e\u4ee3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b2) \u5728\u5b50\u4ee3\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7236\u4ee3\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6837\u672c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ee7\u627f\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7236\u4ee3\u6700\u4f73\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u7ee7\u627f\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ee7\u627f\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5355\u4e2a\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u592a\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u9645\u7ee7\u627f\u901a\u8fc7\u79ef\u7d2f\u8de8\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5e94\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\u7ee7\u627f\u4e3b\u8981\u5bf9\u4e0e\u7236\u4ee3\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5b50\u4ee3\u5f62\u6001\u6709\u76ca\u3002\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u884c\u8d70\u6b65\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ee7\u627f\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u73af\u5883\u5728\u5851\u9020\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "FROST-Drive\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u800c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8d28\u7591\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFROST-Drive\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1\uff09\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6743\u91cd\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eGRU\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u8def\u5f84\u70b9\uff1b4\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u95e8\u4f18\u5316Rater Feedback Score\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728Waymo Open E2E\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4fdd\u7559VLM\u5e7f\u6cdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u662f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fdd\u7559\u5f3a\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing safeguarding concepts, such as Online Verification (OV), provide safety layers that detect infeasible planning outputs. However, they lack an active mechanism to ensure safe operation in the event that the main planner fails. This paper presents a first step toward an active safety extension for fail-operational Autonomous Driving (AD). We deploy a lightweight sampling-based trajectory planner on an automotive-grade, embedded platform running a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The planner continuously computes trajectories under constrained computational resources, forming the foundation for future emergency planning architectures. Experimental results demonstrate deterministic timing behavior with bounded latency and minimal jitter, validating the feasibility of trajectory planning on safety-certifiable hardware. The study highlights both the potential and the remaining challenges of integrating active fallback mechanisms as an integral part of next-generation safeguarding frameworks.

Instead of repetitively scanning embedded photoreceivers, this design uses a stereo vision setup comprising two DVS cameras looking sideways through the skin. Such a design produces events as changes in brightness are detected, and estimates press positions on the 2D skin surface through triangulation, utilizing Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to find the center of mass of contact events resulting from pressing actions. The system is evaluated over a 4620 mm2 probed area of the skin using a meander raster scan. Across 95 % of the presses visible to both cameras, the press localization achieved a Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.66 mm. The results highlight the potential of this approach for wide-area flexible and responsive tactile sensors in soft robotics and interactive environments. Moreover, we examined how the system performs when the amount of event data is strongly reduced. Using stochastic down-sampling, the event stream was reduced to 1/1024 of its original size. Under this extreme reduction, the average localization error increased only slightly (from 4.66 mm to 9.33 mm), and the system still produced valid press localizations for 85 % of the trials. This reduction in pass rate is expected, as some presses no longer produce enough events to form a reliable cluster for triangulation. These results show that the sensing approach remains functional even with very sparse event data, which is promising for reducing power consumption and computational load in future implementations. The system exhibits a detection latency distribution with a characteristic width of 31 ms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67d4\u6027\u5149\u5b66\u6ce2\u5bfc\u76ae\u80a4\u548c\u53cc\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u8f6f\u76ae\u80a4\u89e6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u67d4\u6027\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5149\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u91cd\u590d\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u67d4\u6027\u7845\u80f6\u5149\u5b66\u6ce2\u5bfc\u76ae\u80a4\u4e0e\u4e24\u4e2aDVS\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4eae\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DBSCAN\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u63a5\u89e6\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba12D\u76ae\u80a4\u8868\u9762\u7684\u6309\u538b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u57284620 mm\u00b2\u63a2\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u5185\uff0c95%\u7684\u6309\u538b\u53ef\u89c1\u65f6\u5b9a\u4f4dRMSE\u4e3a4.66 mm\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u5927\u5c0f\u76841/1024\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec5\u589e\u81f39.33 mm\uff0c85%\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4ecd\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e3a31 ms\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u67d4\u6027\u76ae\u80a4\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7a00\u758f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work investigates the latent geometry of user preferences using the MovieLens 32M dataset, implementing a high-performance, parallelized Alternating Least Squares (ALS) framework. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we demonstrate that constrained low-rank models significantly outperform higher dimensional counterparts in generalization, achieving an optimal balance between Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and ranking precision. We visualize the learned embedding space to reveal the unsupervised emergence of semantic genre clusters, confirming that the model captures deep structural relationships solely from interaction data. Finally, we validate the system's practical utility in a cold-start scenario, introducing a tunable scoring parameter to manage the trade-off between popularity bias and personalized affinity effectively.

However, they typically function as semantic reasoners, lacking an intrinsic understanding of the specific robot's physical capabilities. This limitation is particularly critical in interactive navigation, where robots must actively modify cluttered environments to create traversable paths. Existing VLM-based navigators are predominantly confined to passive obstacle avoidance, failing to reason about when and how to interact with objects to clear blocked paths. To bridge this gap, we propose Counterfactual Interactive Navigation via Skill-aware VLM (CoINS), a hierarchical framework that integrates skill-aware reasoning and robust low-level execution. Specifically, we fine-tune a VLM, named InterNav-VLM, which incorporates skill affordance and concrete constraint parameters into the input context and grounds them into a metric-scale environmental representation. By internalizing the logic of counterfactual reasoning through fine-tuning on the proposed InterNav dataset, the model learns to implicitly evaluate the causal effects of object removal on navigation connectivity, thereby determining interaction necessity and target selection. To execute the generated high-level plans, we develop a comprehensive skill library through reinforcement learning, specifically introducing traversability-oriented strategies to manipulate diverse objects for path clearance. A systematic benchmark in Isaac Sim is proposed to evaluate both the reasoning and execution aspects of interactive navigation. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that CoINS significantly outperforms representative baselines, achieving a 17\\% higher overall success rate and over 80\\% improvement in complex long-horizon scenarios compared to the best-performing baseline", "AI": {"tldr": "CoINS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fee\u6539\u73af\u5883\u4ee5\u6e05\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5177\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fee\u6539\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u88ab\u52a8\u907f\u969c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u6e05\u7406\u963b\u585e\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CoINS\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5fae\u8c03InterNav-VLM\uff0c\u5c06\u6280\u80fd\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u7ea6\u675f\u53c2\u6570\u878d\u5165\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u7269\u4f53\u79fb\u9664\u5bf9\u5bfc\u822a\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u53d1\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9762\u5411\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u6027\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u64cd\u7eb5\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u4f53\u4ee5\u6e05\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728Isaac Sim\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCoINS\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8617%\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc780%\u3002", "conclusion": "CoINS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4f4e\u5c42\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning.

We identify a critical ``modality collapse'' phenomenon where strong visual priors overwhelm sparse linguistic signals, causing agents to overfit to specific instruction phrasings while ignoring the underlying semantic intent. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Residual Semantic Steering (RSS)}, a probabilistic framework that disentangles physical affordance from semantic execution. RSS introduces two theoretical innovations: (1) \\textbf{Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration}, which approximates the true semantic posterior via dense, LLM-driven distributional expansion, and (2) \\textbf{Residual Affordance Steering}, a dual-stream decoding mechanism that explicitly isolates the causal influence of language by subtracting the visual affordance prior. Theoretical analysis suggests that RSS effectively maximizes the mutual information between action and intent while suppressing visual distractors. Empirical results across diverse manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that RSS achieves state-of-the-art robustness, maintaining performance even under adversarial linguistic perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faResidual Semantic Steering (RSS)\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6270\u52a8\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6270\u52a8\u5f02\u5e38\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\"\u6a21\u6001\u574d\u584c\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5148\u9a8c\u4f1a\u6df9\u6ca1\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\u8868\u8fbe\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u5e95\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRSS\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u9a8c\uff1b2) Residual Affordance Steering\uff1a\u53cc\u6d41\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u53bb\u89c6\u89c9\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u663e\u5f0f\u9694\u79bb\u8bed\u8a00\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eRSS\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6700\u5927\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u610f\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRSS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RSS\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

By employing contrastive learning, CLAP maps video transitions onto a quantized, physically executable codebook. Building on this representation, we introduce a dual-formulation VLA framework offering both CLAP-NTP, an autoregressive model excelling at instruction following and object generalization, and CLAP-RF, a Rectified Flow-based policy designed for high-frequency, precise manipulation. Furthermore, we propose a Knowledge Matching (KM) regularization strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAP significantly outperforms strong baselines, enabling the effective transfer of skills from human videos to robotic execution.

A Comprehensive Embodied World Model Evaluation Turing Test", "comment": null, "summary": "As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Embodied Turing Test\u57fa\u51c6Wow-wo-val\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\uff1a1\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u591f\u9c81\u68d2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Embodied Turing Test\u57fa\u51c6Wow-wo-val\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e609\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5305\u542b22\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff08>0.93\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u5728Wow-wo-val\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u4e0a\u4ec5\u5f9717.27\u5206\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u9ad868.02\u5206\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u5728\u9006\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63a5\u8fd10%\uff0c\u800cWoW\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u630140.74%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e2d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u548c\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u9700\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u624d\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5SDCD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u6253\u4e71\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u9ad8\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u6e90\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5f31\u7ed3\u6784\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684Bag-of-Patches\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStructure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u6253\u4e71\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u89c6\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u60e9\u7f5a\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7f3a\u5931\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684token\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u7eb9\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSDCD\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LVLMs\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SDCD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control.

Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond.

However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models.

To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles.

In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization.

In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the \"distributional deviations\"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff08MPFT\uff09\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\uff08TAM\uff09\u673a\u5236\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728GenImage\u548cUniversalFakeDetect\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523098.2%\u548c94.6%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u4fb5\u8680\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u89c6\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff08MPFT\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\uff08TAM\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63a9\u7801\u5305\u542b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u533a\u57df\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8feb\u4f7fCLIP-ViT\u5173\u6ce8AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\"\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\"\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728GenImage\u548cUniversalFakeDetect\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5c31\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523098.2%\u548c94.6%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u51bb\u7ed3CLIP\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08CLIP-ViT\uff09\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u805a\u7c7b\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0eAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MPFT\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7TAM\u673a\u5236\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant \"spatial gap\" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential.

However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMFC-RFNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u96f7\u8fbe\u56de\u6ce2\u5e8f\u5217\u964d\u6c34\u4e34\u8fd1\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5e27\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u9519\u4f4d\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6355\u83b7\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u56de\u6ce2\u5e8f\u5217\u964d\u6c34\u4e34\u8fd1\u9884\u62a5\u5bf9\u707e\u5bb3\u7f13\u89e3\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u89c4\u5212\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4f4d\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e27\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u9519\u4f4d\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMFC-RFNet\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5c0f\u6ce2\u5f15\u5bfc\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5(WGSC)\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2) \u7279\u5f81\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5757(FCM)\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53cc\u5411\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b3) \u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u878d\u5408(CGSTF)\u4ece\u6761\u4ef6\u56de\u6ce2\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4) \u91c7\u7528\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c11\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\uff1b5) \u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c3e\u90e8\u3001\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u7b2c\u4e00\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u653e\u7f6e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Vision-RWKV\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6(SEVIR\u3001MeteoNet\u3001Shanghai\u3001CIKM)\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u96e8\u7387\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u56de\u6ce2\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u957f\u9884\u89c1\u671f\u4fdd\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u4e34\u8fd1\u9884\u62a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry.

Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios.

While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u75282D\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u989d\u5916\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u70b9\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u68c0\u6d4b\u624b\u90e8\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u6216\u4ea4\u4e92\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56RGB\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u793a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d222D\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CoTracker\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u70b9\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u5e27\u4e00\u8d77\u4f5c\u4e3aTransformer\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u521d\u59cb\u5e27\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u8054\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6574\u54082D\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u521d\u59cb\u5e27\u53ca\u5176\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "2D\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "BREATH-VL\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u914d\u51c6\u76846-DoF\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6c14\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e6-DoF\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u533b\u7597\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u59ff\u6001\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efaBREATH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4f53\u5185\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faBREATH-VL\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408VLM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u5386\u53f2\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406", "result": "BREATH-VL\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e25.5%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0cBREATH-VL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5185\u7aa5\u955c6-DoF\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1"}}

Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%.

However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space.

We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features.

While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets.

However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMVP\uff08\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3aVideoLLMs\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684VideoLLMs\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6574\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u7406\u89e3\uff08\u5982\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5185\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMVP\uff08\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4e00\u7ec4\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4e2d\u91cd\u6784\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aMVP\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684GRPO\uff08\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cMVP\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5f3a\u5316\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MVP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709VideoLLMs\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u7f3a\u4e4fCAD\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u521b\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u77f3\u5934\u548c\u571f\u8c46\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u4e2d\uff0cAI\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u519c\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u6210\u7684CAD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u66ff\u4ee3CAD\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3CAD\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u626b\u63cf\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u9ad8\u4ee3\u8868\u60273D\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u62103D\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u76843D\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u63cf\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u7f3a\u4e4fCAD\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u63cf\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u6280\u672f\u83b7\u5f973D\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax.

Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies.

Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory.

Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity.

In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management.

Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical \"Full Damage\" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFLNet\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c06Sentinel-2\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4ece10\u7c73\u63d0\u5347\u52303\u7c73\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d2a\u6c34\u540e\u519c\u4f5c\u7269\u635f\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728BFCD-22\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5370\u5ea6\u6d2a\u6c34\u5bf9\u519c\u4f5c\u7269\u9020\u6210\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u67e5\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u4e14\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u536b\u661f\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e91\u5c42\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u4f4e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4f5c\u7269\u635f\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFLNet\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6280\u672f\u5c06Sentinel-2\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u768410\u7c73\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u52303\u7c73\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u635f\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22)\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5c06\"\u5b8c\u5168\u635f\u5bb3\"\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u4ece0.83\u63d0\u5347\u52300.89\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5546\u4e1a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u76840.89\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u5230\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u635f\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5168\u56fd\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "FocusUI\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684UI\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387UI\u622a\u56fe\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6563\u3002\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92UI\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684UI grounding\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "FocusUI\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6570\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684UI\u56fe\u5206\u6570\u6784\u5efapatch\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u6709\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u4e14\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faPosPad\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u4e22\u5f03\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u653e\u7f6e\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u6700\u540e\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2agrounding\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFocusUI\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86GUI\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728ScreenSpot-Pro\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cFocusUI-7B\u76f8\u6bd4GUI-Actor-7B\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53473.7%\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u53ea\u4fdd\u755930%\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d3.2%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b01.44\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u548c17%\u5cf0\u503cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "FocusUI\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u89c6\u89c9token\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86UI grounding\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684UI\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Black", "Omid Taheri"], "title": "FUSION: Full-Body Unified Motion Prior for Body and Hands via Diffusion", "comment": null, "summary": "Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints.

Current automated poster generation systems face significant limitations, including incomplete design workflows, poor text rendering accuracy, and insufficient flexibility for commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design.

While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "REACT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u7578\u53d8\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u7578\u53d8\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7578\u53d8\uff08\u5982\u5f02\u5e38\u7269\u4f53\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7578\u53d8\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7578\u53d8\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u5e26\u63a9\u7801\u635f\u5931\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b4) \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u805a\u7126\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u7578\u53d8\u7684\u5e27\u3002", "result": "REACT\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7578\u53d8\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5f62\u6210\u4e92\u8865\u3002", "conclusion": "REACT\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7578\u53d8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem.

Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "LocalDPO\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u548c\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u6837\u672c\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u4ea7\u751f\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLocalDPO\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\uff08\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a9\u7801\u5c40\u90e8\u7834\u574f\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u751f\u6210\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5DPO\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u9650\u5236\u5728\u7834\u574f\u533a\u57df\uff1b3\uff09\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8", "result": "\u5728Wan2.1\u548cCogVideoX\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLocalDPO\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5206\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "LocalDPO\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709DPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}

However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\"\u6587\u672c\u60ef\u6027\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4e00\u65e6\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u76f2\u76ee\u575a\u6301\u9519\u8bef\u6587\u672c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\"\u6587\u672c\u60ef\u6027\"\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u65e6\u5728\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u76f2\u76ee\u575a\u6301\u9519\u8bef\u6587\u672c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u56fe\u6270\u52a8\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cdLMM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5730\u6ce8\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u673a\u5236\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cbe\u70bc\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u603b\u7ed3\u548c\u53bb\u566a\u63a8\u7406\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0d\u523010%\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u9677\u5165\u76f2\u76ee\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6587\u672c\u60ef\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cbe\u70bc\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces.

However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Klear\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5854\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u5507\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u9000\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u5507\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u3001\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u9000\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u5f31\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6709\u9650\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1. \u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u5854\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00DiT\u5757\u548cOmni-Full Attention\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d27\u5bc6\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5f3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1b2. \u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3. \u6570\u636e\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891-\u5b57\u5e55\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "Klear\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u53ef\u6307\u4ee4\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u5408\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0eVeo 3\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "conclusion": "Klear\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6570\u636e\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diffusion-DRF\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5956\u52b1\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eDPO\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u6613\u88ab\u6b3a\u9a97\uff0c\u5e38\u5f15\u53d1\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiffusion-DRF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u73b0\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u94fe\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64adVLM\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5c06logit\u7ea7\u54cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3atoken\u611f\u77e5\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u65b9\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u9053\u83b7\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6VLM\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u68af\u5ea6\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u66f4\u65b0", "result": "Diffusion-DRF\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u8f7b\u677e\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1", "conclusion": "Diffusion-DRF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5956\u52b1\u6d41\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToTMNet\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5149\u7535\u5bb9\u79ef\u63cf\u8bb0\uff08rPPG\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528FFT\u52a0\u901f\u7684Toeplitz\u65f6\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684rPPG\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u5ea6\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToTMNet\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528FFT\u52a0\u901f\u7684Toeplitz\u65f6\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002Toeplitz\u7b97\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u5d4c\u5165\u548cFFT\u5377\u79ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u5377\u79ef\u5206\u652f\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u5168\u5c40Toeplitz\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u65f6\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728UBFC-rPPG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52301.055 bpm MAE\u548c0.996 Pearson\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff08SCAMPS\u5230UBFC-rPPG\uff09\u8fbe\u52301.582 bpm MAE\u548c0.994 Pearson\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u542b63k\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "Toeplitz\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u662frPPG\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u662f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.
