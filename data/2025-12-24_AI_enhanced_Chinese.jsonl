In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.\n  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.\n  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.\n  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86MAGSAC++\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u65af-\u5747\u5300\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u6548\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6RANSAC\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7a33\u5065\u62df\u5408\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u7b97\u6cd5MAGSAC++\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "1. \u6269\u5c55\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u5230\u7403\u5f62\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u5728\u7a33\u5065\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3. \u5206\u6790MAGSAC++\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u6216\u5c0f\u968f\u673a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b5. \u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5185\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "1.

Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyGE-Occ\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u89c6\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u652f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a3D\u5168\u666f\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u6355\u63493D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5168\u666f\u5206\u79bb\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHyGE-Occ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u89c6\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6df1\u5ea6\u4ed3\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684BEV\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4eceBEV\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u8fb9\u7f18\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fb9\u7f18\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728Occ3D-nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyGE-Occ\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HyGE-Occ\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u89c6\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u652f\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u5168\u666f\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Existing flocking algorithms often struggle with efficiency and scalability, particularly when potential collisions force drones into suboptimal trajectories. This paper presents a time-efficient prioritised scheduling algorithm that improves the initial formation process of drone flocks. The method assigns each drone a priority based on its number of potential collisions and its likelihood of reaching its target position without permanently obstructing other drones. Using this hierarchy, each drone computes an appropriate delay to ensure a collision-free path. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm successfully generates collision-free trajectories for flocks of up to 5000 drones and outperforms the coupling-degree-based heuristic prioritised planning method (CDH-PP) in both performance and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u7f16\u961f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u961f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u7f16\u961f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u4f18", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6f5c\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4e3a\u6bcf\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9002\u5f53\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8def\u5f84", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u591a\u8fbe5000\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8026\u5408\u5ea6\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5(CDH-PP)", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u521d\u59cb\u7f16\u961f\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faWidget2Code\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6UI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edfWidgetFactory\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709UI2Code\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7f51\u9875\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u800c\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6\uff08widgets\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5fae\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u56fe\u6807\u5316\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "1) \u5efa\u7acb\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u5f00\u53d1\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edfWidgetFactory\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00WidgetDSL\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff1b4) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u4e49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u95e8\u7684UI2Code\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3aWidget2Code\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "Widget2Code\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408WidgetFactory\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Personalizing Vision-Language-Action Models with Visual Attentive Prompting", "comment": null, "summary": "While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models generalize well to generic instructions, they struggle with personalized commands such as \"bring my cup\", where the robot must act on one specific instance among visually similar objects. We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control.", "AI": {"tldr": "VAP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u6dfb\u52a0\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u5bf9\u8c61", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u547d\u4ee4\uff08\u5982\"\u62ff\u6211\u7684\u676f\u5b50\"\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u793a\uff08VAP\uff09\uff1a\u5c06\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u89c6\u89c9\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5339\u914d\u5728\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4eae\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u91cd\u5199\u6307\u4ee4\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08Personalized-SIMPLER\u3001Personalized-VLABench\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u684c\u9762\u57fa\u51c6\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cVAP\u5728\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u5bf9\u8c61\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "VAP\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u6dfb\u52a0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c"}}

This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeurAlign\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4f53\u79ef-\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\u8054\u5408\u914d\u51c6\u5927\u8111MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u76ae\u5c42\u548c\u76ae\u5c42\u4e0b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u7403\u5f62\u5750\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u914d\u51c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u8868\u9762\u914d\u51c6\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u5206\u6790\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u914d\u51c6\u5927\u8111\u76ae\u5c42\u548c\u76ae\u5c42\u4e0b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeurAlign\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u7403\u5f62\u5750\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c06\u89e3\u5256\u8868\u9762\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u4f53\u79ef\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u7403\u5f62\u914d\u51c6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u8868\u9762\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cDice\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u8fbe7\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700MRI\u626b\u63cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "NeurAlign\u4ee5\u5176\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u76ae\u5c42\u548c\u76ae\u5c42\u4e0b\u914d\u51c6\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u8868\u9762\u914d\u51c6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines.

However, existing approaches largely rely on data-driven learning, making it difficult to capture the complex logic underlying decision-making through imitation or limited reinforcement rewards. To address this, we propose KnowVal, a new autonomous driving system that enables visual-language reasoning through the synergistic integration of open-world perception and knowledge retrieval. Specifically, we construct a comprehensive driving knowledge graph that encodes traffic laws, defensive driving principles, and ethical norms, complemented by an efficient LLM-based retrieval mechanism tailored for driving scenarios.

However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction.

While tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial fusion, typically implemented through an acoustic Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) integrated with visual-inertial measurements, can provide accurate state estimation, the associated graph-based optimization is often computationally prohibitive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Here we present FAR-AVIO, a Schur-Complement based, tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial odometry framework tailored for underwater robots. FAR-AVIO embeds a Schur complement formulation into an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF), enabling joint pose-landmark optimization for accuracy while maintaining constant-time updates by efficiently marginalizing landmark states. On top of this backbone, we introduce Adaptive Weight Adjustment and Reliability Evaluation(AWARE), an online sensor health module that continuously assesses the reliability of visual, inertial and DVL measurements and adaptively regulates their sigma weights, and we develop an efficient online calibration scheme that jointly estimates DVL-IMU extrinsics, without dedicated calibration manoeuvres. Numerical simulations and real-world underwater experiments consistently show that FAR-AVIO outperforms state-of-the-art underwater SLAM baselines in both localization accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling robust operation on low-power embedded platforms.

This sensor limitation makes the system susceptible to drift from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), particularly during long and fast flights with aggressive maneuvers. This paper presents the system developed for the championship, which achieved a competitive performance. Our approach corrected VIO drift by fusing its output with global position measurements derived from a YOLO-based gate detector using a Kalman filter. A perception-aware planner generated trajectories that balance speed with the need to keep gates visible for the perception system. The system demonstrated high performance, securing podium finishes across multiple categories: third place in the AI Grand Challenge with top speed of 43.2 km/h, second place in the AI Drag Race with over 59 km/h, and second place in the AI Multi-Drone Race.

Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u672c\u5730\u79cd\u690d\u7684\u756a\u77f3\u69b4\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u5728GFDD24\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u7ea699.99%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u519c\u4e1a\u56fd\uff0c\u756a\u77f3\u69b4\u662f\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u70ed\u5e26\u6c34\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u70ad\u75bd\u75c5\u548c\u679c\u8747\u611f\u67d3\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u756a\u77f3\u69b4\u7684\u54c1\u8d28\u548c\u4ea7\u91cf\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u75be\u75c5\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u635f\u5931\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u6536\u6210\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CNN\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCNN-ML\u7ea7\u8054\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c06CNN\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u673a\uff08Gradient Boosting Machine\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u756a\u77f3\u69b4\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728GFDD24\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542b\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u679c\u8747\u611f\u67d3\u548c\u70ad\u75bd\u75c5\u4e09\u7c7b\u756a\u77f3\u69b4\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u7ea699.99%\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CNN-ML\u7ea7\u8054\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u756a\u77f3\u69b4\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u519c\u4e1a\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u756a\u77f3\u69b4\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4ea7\u91cf\u3002"}}

Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction.

Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\\leq95\\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images.

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration.

Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios.

This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns.

Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech.

A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions.

Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations.

Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation.

However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "HEART-ViT\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eHessian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u4e8c\u9636\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u526a\u679dtoken\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "Vision Transformers\u867d\u7136\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e8c\u6b21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406token\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u4e00\u9636\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u8de8\u8f93\u5165\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHEART-ViT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Hessian-vector\u4e58\u79ef\u4f30\u8ba1token\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u635f\u5931\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u5219\u6027\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86token\u526a\u679d\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u800c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5197\u4f59\u79fb\u9664\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-100\u548cImageNet-1K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ViT-B/16\u548cDeiT-B/16\u6a21\u578b\uff0cHEART-ViT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe49.4%\u7684FLOPs\u51cf\u5c11\u300136%\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u548c46%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u572840% token\u526a\u679d\u65f6\u6062\u590d4.7%\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "HEART-ViT\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u66f2\u7387\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53c8\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3aVision Transformers\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models.

However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits.

However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization.

However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "LADLE-MM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\uff08\u4e24\u4e2a\u5355\u6a21\u6001+\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1160.3%\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u64cd\u7eb5\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5e38\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u626d\u66f2\u91cd\u8981\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d9\u4e8b\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLADLE-MM\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u652f\u4f7f\u7528BLIP\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "result": "\u5728DGM4\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLADLE-MM\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u57fa\u7840\u6807\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728VERITE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LADLE-MM\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "D\u00b3ETOR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fa9\u8bba\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u6e10\u8fdb\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982SAM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff1b2\uff09\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6d82\u9e26\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6D\u00b3ETOR\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3aSAM\u5728\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1FADeNet\uff0c\u6e10\u8fdb\u878d\u5408\u591a\u7ea7\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6d82\u9e26\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u6d82\u9e26\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0cD\u00b3ETOR\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions.

In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP.

They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis.

Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "DETACH\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5916\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u9002\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5916\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b64\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u5982\u7ec6\u5fae\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u9f50", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDETACH\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u805a\u7c7b\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u611f\u5668-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\uff1b3\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4e92\u76d1\u7763\u5efa\u7acb\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u7b80\u5355\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3001\u56f0\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5047\u8d1f\u6837\u672c", "result": "\u5728Opportunity++\u548cHWU-USP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2-\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb", "conclusion": "DETACH\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5916\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u6355\u6349\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u533a\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5f02\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7eb9\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f4e\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u70b9\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3\uff08TBSD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u7eb9\u7406\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6355\u83b7\u6f5c\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u9488\u5bf9\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7eb9\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness.

While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94RGB\u4e0e\u957f\u6ce2\u7ea2\u5916\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5730\u8868\u5730\u96f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0cYOLOv11\u572835,640\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523086.8% mAP\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c10-30%\u70ed\u878d\u5408\u57285-10\u7c73\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u96f7\u4ecd\u662f\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4eba\u9053\u4e3b\u4e49\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5168\u740360\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u67091.1\u4ebf\u679a\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5730\u96f7\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e74\u9020\u62102.6\u4e07\u4eba\u4f24\u4ea1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u5730\u96f7\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u571f\u58e4\u7684\u70ed\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408RGB\u548c\u957f\u6ce2\u7ea2\u5916\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u5730\u8868\u5730\u96f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528YOLO\u67b6\u6784(v8, v10, v11)\u5728114\u5f20\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c35,640\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94RGB\u4e0e\u957f\u6ce2\u7ea2\u5916\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u878d\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86RF-DETR\u3001Faster R-CNN\u3001YOLOv11\u548cRetinaNet\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "YOLOv11\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd(86.8% mAP)\uff0c10-30%\u70ed\u878d\u5408\u57285-10\u7c73\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e3a\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570\u3002RF-DETR\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8(69.2% mAP)\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u8017\u65f612\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0cYOLOv11(64.2% mAP)\u4ec5\u970041\u5206\u949f\u3002\u805a\u5408\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u5b63\u8282\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad81.8-9.6%\u3002\u53cd\u5766\u514b\u5730\u96f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u738761.9%\uff0c\u53cd\u4eba\u5458\u5730\u96f7\u4ec519.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94RGB-LWIR\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5730\u8868\u5730\u96f7\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cYOLOv11\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672a\u6765\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u57cb\u6df1\u548c\u571f\u58e4\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u70ed\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously.

A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module.

Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.\n  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.\n  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression.

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling.

We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faL-IVA\u57fa\u51c6\u548cORCA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u5177\u5907\u4e3b\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u8ffd\u6c42\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u88ab\u52a8\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faORCA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u95ed\u73afOTAR\u5faa\u73af\uff08\u89c2\u5bdf-\u601d\u8003-\u884c\u52a8-\u53cd\u601d\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff1b2) \u5206\u5c42\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf2\u8fdb\u884c\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf1\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u8ba1\u5212\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u5c06\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u63a7\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aPOMDP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cORCA\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u73af\u548c\u975e\u53cd\u601d\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "ORCA\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u52a8\u753b\u63a8\u8fdb\u5230\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticGen\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5148\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u540eVAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u5316\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfVAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5728VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7VAE\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u751f\u6210\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4ea7\u751f\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6bd4\u5728VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSemanticGen\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0cSemanticGen\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
