### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个分析框架来研究AI系统在有限时间内无限增长的条件，通过物理和信息理论限制定义服务包络，并提供了可测试的失控增长认证条件和实际可实施的安全控制措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统在什么可测量条件下能力会无限增长，以及在什么条件下可以排除这种可能性，旨在用可测试的条件和可部署的控制措施取代对AI奇点的猜测。

Method: 开发递归自我改进的分析框架，将能力增长与资源建设和部署策略联系起来，利用功率、带宽和内存的物理和信息理论限制定义服务包络，建立内源性增长模型。

Result: 推导出将可观测序列映射为失控与非奇异行为yes/no认证的决策规则，提供了基于改进速度相对于当前水平的加速程度可证伪测试，以及功率上限、吞吐量限制和评估门等实际可实施的安全控制。

Conclusion: 该框架用可测试的条件和可部署的控制措施取代了对AI奇点的猜测，为认证或排除AI奇点提供了理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了在真实世界模型（如Stable Diffusion）上大规模应用数据归因方法的重要进展。

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并验证了首个基于共识的视频评估工具ColoWorkflow，用于微创结直肠手术的工作流程分析，建立了可重复的评估框架，支持机构间基准测试和AI驱动的工作流程识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创结直肠手术存在程序变异性大、学习曲线困难、并发症影响质量和结果的问题，视频评估工具可以生成数据驱动的见解来减少变异性、优化培训并改善手术表现。

Method: 通过Delphi流程达成关于通用工作流程描述符的共识，开发ColoWorkflow工具，并由独立评估者将其应用于多中心腹腔镜和机器人结直肠手术视频数据集，评估适用性和评估者间可靠性。

Result: 达成了10个程序无关阶段和34个程序特定步骤的共识，ColoWorkflow应用于54个结直肠手术视频，显示出广泛的适用性，评估者间可靠性中等（阶段K=0.71，步骤K=0.66）。

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow是首个基于共识的、经过验证的VBA工具，为微创结直肠手术的全面工作流程分析建立了可重复框架，可能标准化培训、加速能力获取并推进数据知情的手术质量改进。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

### [7] [PhaseWin Search Framework Enable Efficient Object-Level Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10914)
*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin是一种新颖的阶段窗口搜索算法，用于对象级基础模型的忠实区域归因，以近线性复杂度实现高效归因，相比传统贪婪方法显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于子模子集选择的归因方法虽然忠实度高，但效率限制阻碍了在实际场景中的部署应用。

Method: 采用分阶段粗到细搜索策略，结合自适应剪枝、窗口化细粒度选择和动态监督机制，替代传统二次成本的贪婪选择。

Result: 理论上在温和单调子模假设下保持近似贪婪保证；实证中仅用20%计算预算就达到贪婪归因95%以上的忠实度，在对象检测和视觉定位任务中优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: PhaseWin为对象级多模态模型建立了可扩展、高忠实度归因的新技术标准。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

### [8] [Out-of-Distribution Detection with Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10923)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种正负提示监督方法，通过优化正负提示来增强基于能量的OOD检测器性能，在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在OOD检测中使用负提示时，往往包含过于广泛的非ID特征，导致捕获重叠或误导性信息，影响检测效果。

Method: 使用大语言模型初始化类别特定的正负提示，优化后正提示关注类内特征，负提示强调类别边界特征，并通过图架构传播语义监督到视觉分支。

Conclusion: 提出的正负提示监督方法能有效提升OOD检测性能，通过优化提示表示和语义知识传递实现了更好的检测效果。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n两种轻量级模型在面部表情识别任务中的性能，发现在干净数据集上YOLOv12n表现更好，而在噪声数据上YOLOv11n具有更高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索轻量级YOLO模型在无约束真实环境中的面部表情识别性能，平衡计算效率与识别准确率。

Method: 将FER2013和KDEF两个分类数据集转换为目标检测格式，使用mAP 0.5、精确率、召回率和混淆矩阵评估YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n模型性能。

Result: YOLOv12n在干净KDEF数据集上获得95.6 mAP 0.5的最高性能，在FER2013上mAP为63.8；YOLOv11n在FER2013上精确率达65.2，假阳性更少。

Conclusion: 轻量级YOLO模型能有效平衡性能与效率，YOLOv12n对表情变化更敏感，YOLOv11n在噪声环境中更可靠，适合实时资源受限的情感AI应用。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

### [10] [Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10942)
*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为异构互补蒸馏（HCD）的方法，用于解决异质架构知识蒸馏中的特征表示差异问题。该方法通过整合教师和学生的互补特征，在共享逻辑中实现表示对齐，并通过子逻辑解耦蒸馏和正交性损失来促进多样化的知识转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的知识蒸馏方法主要针对同质架构设计，在异质架构（如ViT到ResNet18）蒸馏中面临空间特征表示差异的挑战。现有的异质蒸馏方法要么计算成本高、设计复杂，要么过度依赖逻辑对齐，无法充分利用互补特征。

Method: 提出HCD框架：1）通过卷积投影器和自适应池化处理学生中间特征，与教师倒数第二层特征拼接；2）使用互补特征映射器（CFM）模块生成共享逻辑；3）引入子逻辑解耦蒸馏（SDD）将共享逻辑划分为n个子逻辑，与教师逻辑融合以修正分类；4）提出正交性损失（OL）确保子逻辑多样性并减少冗余知识转移。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、细粒度数据集（如CUB200）和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，HCD优于最先进的知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: HCD通过保留学生特定优势并利用教师知识，增强了学生的鲁棒性和泛化能力，成为异质知识蒸馏的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

TL;DR: 提出FedBCS方法解决联邦学习中医学图像分割的特征异质性问题，通过领域不变上下文原型对齐来桥接特征表示差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 引入频域自适应风格重校准来构建原型，解耦内容-风格表示并学习最优风格参数；设计上下文感知的双层级原型对齐方法，从编码器和解码器的不同层提取领域不变原型并与上下文信息融合。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法表现出显著性能。

Conclusion: FedBCS通过领域不变上下文原型对齐有效解决了联邦学习中的特征异质性问题，提升了医学图像分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

*Ren Zhang,Huilai Li,Chao qi,Guoliang Xu,Tianyu Zhou,Wei wei,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT-LLM是一个用于微表情识别的多模态大语言模型，通过多专家解耦实现运动语义对齐，解决了静态外观与动态运动线索纠缠以及文本标签与面部肌肉运动语义鸿沟的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别对于推断真实情绪至关重要，但现有方法面临两个核心挑战：静态外观与动态运动线索的纠缠阻碍模型关注细微运动；现有MER数据集的文本标签与面部肌肉运动不完全对应，存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出DEFT-LLM方法，通过多专家解耦实现运动语义对齐。首先构建Uni-MER运动驱动指令数据集，利用光流和动作单元标签的双重约束确保时空一致性和运动对应性。然后设计包含三个专家的架构，将面部动态解耦为独立可解释的表征（结构、动态纹理和运动语义）。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的MER基准测试中展示了最先进的性能，并在局部面部运动的可解释建模方面具有特别优势。

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM通过将Uni-MER的指令对齐知识集成到模型中，为微表情注入了有效的物理先验，同时利用大语言模型的跨模态推理能力，实现了对细微情绪线索的精确捕捉。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

TL;DR: ERMoE是一种稀疏MoE架构，通过将专家重新参数化为学习正交特征基，并用特征基得分（输入特征与专家基的余弦相似度）替代学习门控逻辑，实现内容感知路由，解决路由不稳定和专家利用不足问题，无需显式负载平衡损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE架构中的两个核心挑战：路由器逻辑与专家内部结构不对齐导致路由不稳定和专家利用不足，以及负载不平衡造成的瓶颈问题。标准解决方案（如辅助负载平衡损失）会削弱专家专业化并损害下游性能。

Method: 将每个专家重新参数化为学习的正交特征基，用特征基得分（输入特征与专家基的余弦相似度）替代学习门控逻辑，实现内容感知路由，直接根据专家表示空间分配token。

Result: 在ImageNet分类和跨模态图像-文本检索基准（COCO、Flickr30K）上达到最先进准确率，自然产生更平坦的专家负载分布。3D MRI变体（ERMoE-ba）将脑年龄预测准确率提高7%以上，并产生解剖学上可解释的专家专业化。

Conclusion: ERMoE为稀疏专家模型引入了新的架构原则，直接解决路由不稳定问题，在保持稀疏性的同时实现可扩展、可解释的专业化，无需显式平衡损失。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

TL;DR: DMC是一个用于CLIP模型类增量学习的双阶段框架，通过解耦视觉编码器和文本软提示的优化来解决分类器偏差问题。DMC-OT是其增强版本，引入最优传输校准策略来对齐内存统计信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在持续学习场景中面临分类器偏差问题，学习新类别的任务特定软提示会导致对近期类别的过拟合，同时视觉编码器更新时会产生分布漂移。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段冻结文本提示优化视觉编码器，第二阶段冻结视觉编码器优化文本软提示。DMC-OT额外引入最优传输引导的校准策略来对齐内存统计信息。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、Imagenet-R、CUB-200和UCF-101上的实验表明，DMC和DMC-OT都达到了最先进的性能，DMC-OT平均准确率进一步提高了1.80%。

Conclusion: DMC框架通过解耦视觉和文本模态的优化，有效缓解了CLIP模型在类增量学习中的分类器偏差问题，DMC-OT通过统计校准进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

### [15] [PAS: A Training-Free Stabilizer for Temporal Encoding in Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10979)
*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)方法，通过多相位聚合平滑时间核，解决视频LLM中的时间不一致性问题，无需训练即可提升模型对微小时间偏移的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLM存在时间不一致性问题：帧时序的微小变化会导致注意力翻转并抑制相关帧。这种不稳定性源于多模态RoPE扩展导致的逆傅里叶时间核在帧尺度上产生波纹，扰乱了本应由原始查询键内积控制的注意力机制。

Method: 提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)方法：在多个注意力头中应用小的相反相位偏移，然后聚合它们的输出。该方法保持每个头的频谱幅度，同时通过聚合有效平滑时间核并降低相位敏感性，而不改变位置编码结构。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，在相同token预算下，PAS方法带来了持续的性能提升，计算开销可忽略不计。分析表明，平滑时间核可使注意力对微小时间偏移具有Lipschitz稳定性。

Conclusion: PAS提供了一种即插即用的升级方案，用于增强视频LLM中的鲁棒时间编码，通过多相位平均衰减高频波纹，同时保持每个头的频谱在奈奎斯特有效采样下不变。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的二值验证工作流，通过量化和二值化将开放性问题转换为多项选择题和真/假验证问题，显著提升零样本视觉任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在零样本视觉任务中表现不佳，特别是处理开放性问题时。需要一种无需额外训练、能提升推理准确性的通用方法。

Method: 采用两步工作流：1) 量化：将开放性问题转换为多项选择题；2) 二值化：将每个候选项转换为真/假问题，通过确定性逻辑解决。

Result: 在指代表达式定位、空间推理和BLINK-Jigsaw等任务上，相比直接回答开放性问题，量化带来显著提升，二值化提供额外增益。

Conclusion: 该工作流提供了一种简单统一的推理时设计方法，无需任务特定训练，可显著提升现有视觉语言模型的零样本视觉性能。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

Result: 实验结果显示在重建液体几何和体积方面提高了准确性和一致性，优于现有基准。

Conclusion: Phys-Liquid数据集和相关验证方法促进了透明液体感知任务的未来发展。

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

TL;DR: CLUE是一个基于Stable Diffusion的可控生成模型框架，通过固定格式提示词实现多样性和稳定性的平衡，无需额外数据，特别适用于医学等数据有限的领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在医学等专业领域中，由于数据类型有限和数据量不足，现有文本到图像生成方法难以实现多样性和稳定性平衡的问题。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，引入Style Encoder处理图像和提示词生成风格嵌入，通过新的第二注意力层和Kullback-Leibler散度实现与提示词无关的连续高斯潜在空间表示。

Result: 在中耳炎数据集上，FID从46.81降至9.30，召回率从49.60%提升至70.29%。仅使用合成数据训练的分类器F1分数达83.21%，合成与真实数据结合时F1分数达94.76%。

Conclusion: CLUE能够从有限数据集中实现多样且稳定的图像生成，是领域特定应用的有效数据增强方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

TL;DR: PROMISE是一个新颖的多模态框架，通过提示注意分层对比学习来解决模态缺失问题，显著提升跨模态表示的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在现实场景中遇到模态缺失时性能显著下降，主要原因是完整多模态数据与不完整模态场景之间的表示学习不一致。现有方法通过相对简单的生成方法处理缺失模态，但无法充分保持跨模态一致性。

Method: PROMISE创新地将多模态提示学习整合到分层对比学习框架中，配备专门设计的提示注意机制，动态生成缺失模态场景下的鲁棒且一致的表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验和全面消融研究明确证明，PROMISE相比当前最先进的多模态方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: PROMISE通过提示注意分层对比学习有效弥合完整数据与不完整数据之间的表示差距，显著提升了模态缺失情况下的跨模态表示鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统主要关注低层次视觉指标而忽视情感维度，视频领域缺乏专门资源来连接情感理解与生成任务，特别是在风格化和非现实场景中。

Method: 构建EmoVid数据集，包含情感标签、视觉属性和文本描述；通过系统分析发现视觉特征与情感感知的时空模式；基于Wan2.1模型开发情感条件化视频生成技术。

Result: 在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中，生成视频的定量指标和视觉质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: EmoVid为情感视频计算设立了新基准，不仅为艺术风格视频的视觉情感分析提供了宝贵见解，还为增强视频生成中的情感表达提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中存在"视觉处理瓶颈"，容易在长时间生成过程中失去对视觉证据的把握，缺乏情境化的视觉体验。

Method: 基于人类认知记忆理论，提出VisMem框架，包含短期模块用于细粒度感知保留和长期模块用于抽象语义整合，通过动态潜在视觉记忆在推理过程中无缝调用。

Result: 在理解、推理和生成等多样化视觉基准测试中，VisMem相比原始模型平均性能提升11.8%，且优于所有对比方法。

Conclusion: VisMem建立了一种新的潜在空间记忆增强范式，能够同时保持感知保真度和语义一致性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时间引导方法缺乏自适应性和选择性，无法根据提示词调整引导强度，也无法仅针对图像的不安全区域进行引导，这限制了安全生成的效果。

Method: SP-Guard通过估计提示词的危害程度，并应用选择性引导掩码来仅对图像中的不安全区域进行引导，从而避免对安全内容的意外修改。

Result: 实验表明，SP-Guard比现有方法生成更安全的图像，同时最大限度地减少对内容的意外改变。

Conclusion: 除了提高安全性外，研究结果还强调了图像生成中透明度和可控性的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

Conclusion: SUPER解码器块具有即插即用的通用性，在统一的重构感知框架内实现高频保真度和全局一致性，同时保持可比较的计算成本。

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Conclusion: 微调实验证实了空中协作感知和推理中模拟到真实转移的可行性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型未能利用胚胎发育的分布先验来提高准确性，且依赖单焦点信息导致胚胎表示不完整，在细胞遮挡下容易产生特征模糊。

Method: 提出两阶段扩散框架：1）训练冻结的帧级编码器提取多焦点特征；2）引入多焦点特征融合策略构建3D感知形态表示，设计混合语义边界条件块注入扩散去噪过程。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上达到最先进结果，仅需单次去噪步骤即可获得最佳平均测试性能，准确率分别达到82.8%和81.3%。

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff通过扩散模型和多焦点特征融合有效解决了胚胎发育阶段识别中的特征模糊问题，显著提升了分类准确性。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合粒度缓存方法（HGC），通过在不同计算阶段采用不同粒度的缓存策略来降低可控生成模型的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可控生成模型在处理控制条件和内容生成时计算需求大，导致生成效率普遍较低。

Method: 采用粗粒度缓存（块级）基于特征重用来动态绕过模型推理各步骤间编码器-解码器块的冗余计算；设计细粒度缓存（提示级）在模块内重用连续推理步骤间的交叉注意力图，并将其扩展到相邻步骤的对应模块计算。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了HGC的有效性，特别是在平衡生成效率和视觉质量方面的优势。在COCO-Stuff分割基准上，计算成本（MACs）显著降低63%（从18.22T到6.70T），同时语义保真度损失控制在1.5%以内。

Conclusion: HGC方法能够显著提高可控生成模型的效率，同时保持良好的视觉质量。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

Conclusion: CrossMed为评估医学视觉语言模型的零样本、跨任务和模态无关泛化能力提供了严格的测试平台，多模态大模型在组合泛化方面表现独特优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Motivation: 现有生成式图像合成方法在同时保持细节和调整前景姿态/视角方面存在困难，需要改进以实现更高质量的图像合成。

Method: 扩展现有生成式合成模型为多参考版本，允许使用任意数量的前景参考图像，并校准参考图像的全局和局部特征以兼容背景信息。

Conclusion: 通过多参考特征校准，生成式图像合成模型能够更好地平衡细节保持和前景姿态/视角调整的需求。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteAttention利用扩散注意力中稀疏模式的时序一致性，通过在去噪序列中传播跳过决策来消除冗余注意力计算，在不降低质量的情况下显著加速视频扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散变换器加速方法面临基本权衡：动态估计稀疏注意力模式计算开销大且存在估计误差，而静态稀疏模式固定且在去噪过程中通常次优。

Method: 识别扩散注意力具有跨去噪步骤的强时序一致性特性，引入LiteAttention方法，利用这种时序一致性在去噪序列中实现演化计算跳过，早期标记非必要tile并向前传播跳过决策。

Result: 在FlashAttention基础上实现高度优化的LiteAttention内核，在生产视频扩散模型上展示了显著加速效果，且没有质量下降。

Conclusion: LiteAttention结合了动态方法的自适应性和静态方法的效率，通过利用时序一致性消除了冗余注意力计算，无需重复分析开销。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

TL;DR: S2D-Align是一种新颖的监督微调范式，通过利用不同粒度的辅助信号建立解剖学基础的跨模态对齐，采用浅到深策略逐步丰富对齐过程，在放射学报告生成任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的放射学报告生成方法主要关注通过监督微调优化X光片和报告之间的跨模态对齐，但由于仅进行实例级对齐且报告具有模板化特性，导致生成质量不理想，缺乏解剖学基础的对齐。

Conclusion: S2D-Align为增强复杂多模态生成任务中的基础能力提供了一个有前景的方向，证明了渐进式解剖学基础对齐策略的有效性。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种有前景的生成模型——去噪扩散概率模型和自回归因果变换器，在生成形状建模和补全任务中的表现。结果显示扩散模型在连续潜在空间中表现最佳，而自回归模型在相同离散潜在空间下也能达到或超越扩散模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然生成模型已在包括3D数据在内的多种数据模态中得到广泛应用，但关于哪种模型最适合特定任务尚未达成共识。此外，像文本和图像这样的条件信息经常被用于引导生成过程，而其他条件如部分3D数据尚未得到充分评估。

Method: 比较了两种最有前景的生成模型：去噪扩散概率模型和自回归因果变换器，并将它们适配用于生成形状建模和补全任务。进行了全面的定量评估和比较，包括基线判别模型和广泛的消融研究。

Result: 研究结果显示：(1) 具有连续潜在空间的扩散模型在从单个噪声深度图像进行多模态形状补全的任务中，超越了判别模型和自回归方法，并在现实条件下实现了最先进的性能；(2) 当在相同的离散潜在空间中进行比较时，自回归模型在这些任务上能够匹配或超越扩散模型的性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在连续潜在空间中表现最优，而自回归模型在相同离散潜在空间下也能达到类似或更好的性能，为不同场景下的3D形状生成和补全任务提供了有价值的模型选择指导。

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD)框架和Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO)方法，旨在激发和利用多模态大语言模型中的内部知识推理能力，解决KBVQA中推理过程不明确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KBVQA方法要么通过上下文学习利用MLLM的隐式知识，要么通过检索增强生成利用显式知识，但它们的推理过程仍然不明确，缺乏从MLLM中获得的明确多步轨迹。

Method: 首先通过提示冻结的7B规模MLLM完成问题与其真实答案之间的推理过程，构建Hindsight-Zero训练数据；然后将其自蒸馏为Chain-of-Thought生成器和知识生成器；最后使用KEPO优化知识生成器，偏好低置信度但有用的知识。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA上的实验验证了HinD的有效性，表明使用7B规模MLLM激发的推理能力无需商业模型API或外部知识即可实现优越性能。

Conclusion: HinD框架成功解决了KBVQA中推理监督问题和知识正确性与置信度不匹配的问题，为激发MLLM内部知识推理能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Conclusion: OT-ALD成功解决了DDIB方法的局限性，在保持其优势的同时显著提升了翻译效率和质量，验证了最优传输理论在图像翻译中的有效性。

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于混响变换的轨迹预测模型Rev，通过可学习的混响核显式建模和预测智能体对轨迹变化事件的不同延迟响应，实现了可控的轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法难以显式学习和预测智能体对轨迹变化事件的延迟响应（latencies），这会影响预测系统的因果连续性并导致不合理的轨迹。不同智能体对特定事件可能有不同的注意、处理和反应延迟偏好。

Method: 受声学中混响曲线的启发，提出了混响变换和相应的Rev轨迹预测模型，使用两个显式可学习的混响核来模拟和预测每个智能体的不同延迟偏好及其随机性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Rev在保持竞争力的预测精度的同时，能够揭示跨智能体和场景的可解释延迟动态。定性分析验证了所提混响变换的特性。

Conclusion: 混响变换作为一种通用的延迟建模方法具有潜力，能够实现基于预测延迟的可控轨迹预测。

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD为计算资源受限的实际应用提供了一种高度实用且可行的解决方案，能够有效区分异常类型并减少模型维护成本。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多视角视频常因相机触发延迟或独立录制设置导致时序不同步，而现有4D高斯泼溅方法假设输入视频流时序同步，这限制了其在真实场景中的应用。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效处理时序错位视频，并显著提升基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的时序对齐策略增强了4DGS框架在异步数据上的鲁棒性，为现实世界多视角视频重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Conclusion: Viper-F1通过状态空间模型和视觉定位增强，在保持高效推理的同时提升了多模态理解的细粒度性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型取得了显著进展，但其在保持语义不变的小输入变化下的可靠性仍未被充分理解，需要系统评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 通过像素级偏移、几何变换、缩放填充、改写和多语言重写等不改变语义的扰动，在多个模型和数据集上进行大规模系统性测试。

Result: 现代VLMs对微小扰动高度敏感，即使最先进系统也常在几个像素的偏移或无害改写下失败；稳定样本更可能被正确回答；小模型稳定性模式可预测大模型正确性。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs存在基本脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动的鲁棒性评估，重点关注模型应可靠保持的不变性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 配备模块化组件的基础模型不受初始训练范围限制，可以发展为医学成像的多任务、多模态系统。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Conclusion: GSD框架通过利用视频扩散模型的先验知识，有效解决了3D高斯溅射在稀疏视图下的过拟合问题，提高了3D场景表示的质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: 这种偏差源于或受多种因素放大，包括位置编码方案、训练损失、上下文重要性以及多模态训练中使用图像-文本对的性质。

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data.

### [54] [DoReMi: A Domain-Representation Mixture Framework for Generalizable 3D Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11232)
*Mingwei Xing,Xinliang Wang,Yifeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoReMi是一个混合专家框架，通过联合建模领域感知专家分支和统一表示分支，解决多源点云领域异构性问题，在多个3D理解基准上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D深度学习在多领域泛化受限，主要由于数据集规模有限和多源点云的高度异构性。不同传感器采集的点云在密度和噪声分布上存在显著差异，导致多领域融合时出现负迁移。现有方法要么只关注领域感知特征，要么只关注领域通用特征，忽略了二者之间的协同潜力。

Method: 提出DoReMi框架，包含领域感知专家分支和统一表示分支。通过领域引导空间路由动态激活专家分支，使用熵控制动态分配实现稳定高效的专家利用。统一表示分支通过鲁棒多属性自监督学习预训练并保持冻结，保留跨领域几何和结构先验。

Result: 在多个3D理解基准上评估，DoReMi在ScanNet Val上达到80.1% mIoU，在S3DIS上达到77.2% mIoU，表现出与现有方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: DoReMi展示了作为未来3D理解研究基础框架的强大潜力，能够自适应建模多样领域分布，同时保持全局一致性。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在显著减少LoRA参数的情况下，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的MoE LoRA框架能够有效解决少样本风格编辑问题，在参数效率和性能方面都表现出色。

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEODE模型通过解耦3D推理和数值生成，解决了现有视觉语言模型在3D空间理解上的双重瓶颈问题，使用1.5B参数实现了与7B+模型相媲美的空间推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在理解真实世界3D空间智能方面存在根本性困难，主要原因是输入阶段的几何感知编码器计算成本高与2D特征浅层化冲突，以及输出阶段的离散分词器无法生成精确连续数值。

Method: 引入GEODE架构，包含两个即插即用模块：解耦推理模块(DRM)作为空间协处理器，通过交叉注意力对齐3D数据与2D视觉特征，并将空间思维链逻辑蒸馏为可注入的推理标记；直接回归头(DRH)采用"嵌入即值"范式，将专用控制标记路由到轻量级MLP进行精确连续回归。

Result: 1.5B参数的模型作为高级语义分发器，在空间推理性能上达到最先进水平，可媲美7B+模型。

Conclusion: GEODE通过解耦3D推理和数值生成的双模块架构，有效解决了视觉语言模型在3D空间理解上的双重瓶颈问题，实现了高效且精确的空间智能。

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于自闭症儿童注视目标检测的新AI框架SACF，通过利用社交上下文来克服数据不平衡问题，在首个自闭症注视目标数据集AGT上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自闭症儿童缺乏足够的专业支持来改善生活质量，自动化的注视目标检测系统可以测量联合注意力这一自闭症核心挑战，具有重要应用价值。

Method: 提出社交感知的粗到细(SACF)注视检测框架，采用双路径架构，分别处理社交和非社交注视，通过上下文感知门模块指导，专门解决自闭症数据中因儿童较少注视面部导致的类别不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为自闭症儿童的注视目标检测提供了有效的AI解决方案，通过社交上下文建模成功克服了数据不平衡挑战，为构建自动化联合注意力测量系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountSteer是一种无需训练的方法，通过引导扩散模型在推理过程中的交叉注意力隐藏状态，提高文本到图像生成中对象数量控制的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真连贯的图像，但经常无法正确遵循文本中的数字指令，这揭示了语言和视觉表示之间的差距。研究发现这些模型并非完全对数字不敏感，它们隐式地知道自己的计数准确性。

Method: 基于模型内部对数值正确性的潜在认知，CountSteer在推理过程中引导模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态，无需额外训练即可改善对象数量生成。

Result: 实验表明，CountSteer将对象计数准确性提高了约4%，同时不损害视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现更可控和语义可靠的文本到图像生成提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

*Melika Behjati,James Henderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视觉语言模型，通过将标题标记分组来捕获语言的细粒度表示，并与经过训练以发现对象的图像编码器输出对齐，从而改善模型对视觉和语言的细粒度理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型主要关注将图像块与语言标记对齐，但图像块对人类视觉没有意义，单个标记也不一定携带图像中的可接地信息。需要将标记分组来描述场景的不同方面。

Method: 提出一种模型，在其架构中将标题标记分组以捕获语言的细粒度表示，并将这些表示与经过对象发现训练的图像编码器输出对齐。

Result: 通过学习标记分组，视觉语言模型对视觉和语言具有更好的细粒度理解。模型发现的标记组在定性和定量上都与文本中的可接地短语高度相似。

Conclusion: 通过标记分组方法可以显著提升视觉语言模型的细粒度理解能力，并且发现的标记组能够有效对应文本中的语义单元。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模型无关的方法，通过交通场景图来增强基于语言的自动驾驶模型的关系推理能力，在LangAuto基准测试中显著提升了驾驶性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在自动驾驶规划中缺乏对空间结构和动态交互关系依赖的显式监督，限制了它们从原始传感器数据推断交通实体间相互影响的能力。

Method: 提出了一种模型无关的方法，将不同抽象层次和格式的场景图序列化，并通过结构化提示模板将其整合到模型中，系统分析关系监督的效益。

Result: 在LangAuto基准测试中，场景图条件化使最先进方法的驾驶性能获得大幅提升：LMDrive驾驶得分提升15.6%，BEVDriver提升17.5%。

Conclusion: 即使测试时不需要场景图输入，模型也能通过场景图条件化训练更好地内化和基础关系先验知识，显著改善自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖硬二进制阈值定义正负样本，丢弃了连续的解剖相似性信息，且忽略了全局解剖进展的方向一致性，导致特征空间扭曲无法捕捉跨患者的规范解剖流形。

Method: CORAL采用对比排序目标利用连续解剖相似性，确保切片间特征距离与其解剖位置差异成比例；同时引入序数目标强制全局方向一致性，将学习到的特征分布与跨患者的规范解剖进展对齐。

Result: CORAL在有限标注设置下的基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时学习到具有有意义解剖结构的表示。

Conclusion: 通过协调学习框架，CORAL能够学习解剖知情的表示，有益于下游分割任务，并在有限标注场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure. Code is available at https://github.com/haoyiwang25/CORAL.

Abstract: Gaze redirection methods aim to generate realistic human face images with controllable eye movement. However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的水印方法依赖手工噪声模拟层进行训练，这限制了它们对未知失真的泛化能力。需要开发能够同时抵抗传统信号处理和新型语义编辑攻击的鲁棒图像水印方法。

Method: 利用图像低频分量对多种攻击的鲁棒性，通过预训练的变分自编码器(VAE)将水印与结构稳定的图像表示绑定，直接在低频分量的深度特征空间中嵌入水印，完全消除训练过程中的噪声模拟需求。

Conclusion: SimuFreeMark通过利用低频分量的固有稳定性，成功开发了一种免噪声模拟的水印框架，在保持视觉质量的同时显著提高了对各类攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AUVIC框架，用于解决多模态大语言模型中视觉概念遗忘的问题，通过对抗性扰动实现精确的目标概念移除，同时保持相关实体的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在优化过程中使用大量数据集，这些数据可能包含敏感或受版权保护的内容。监管框架要求'被遗忘权'，因此需要机器遗忘技术来移除目标数据而无需重新训练。然而，视觉概念遗忘在MLLMs中研究不足，主要挑战是精确移除目标视觉概念而不影响相关实体性能。

Conclusion: AUVIC框架成功解决了MLLMs中视觉概念遗忘的挑战，实现了精确的目标概念移除，同时保持了模型在相关实体上的性能，为机器遗忘技术在多模态场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Conclusion: DocSLM为轻量级边缘设备提供了可靠的多模态文档理解能力，显著降低了资源需求同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

Motivation: 解决事件视觉领域缺乏与帧基计算机视觉相媲美的综合合成数据资源的问题。

Method: 采用物理渲染场景和模拟线性相机运动生成事件序列，系统评估了事件表示方法，发现线性衰减时间表面和双通道极性编码效果最佳。

Result: 线性衰减时间表面和双通道极性编码在姿态估计性能上显著优于指数衰减和单通道替代方案，极性信息对性能提升贡献最大。

Conclusion: 该数据集为事件视觉研究提供了结构化格式的数据资源，包括原始事件流和预计算的最优表示，便于直接研究和可重复基准测试。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型虽然重建精度高，但难以泛化到训练分布之外，这源于精确3D监督使模型过度拟合固定坐标模式而非学习本质的3D结构和运动语义线索。

Method: 提出Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ)将2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并引入视图一致性、方向一致性和物理合理性等3D无关正则化目标。

Result: 仅使用2D运动数据训练，Free3D能生成多样化、时间连贯且语义对齐的3D运动，性能达到甚至超过完全3D监督的模型。

Conclusion: 放松显式3D监督能促进更强的结构推理和泛化能力，为3D运动生成提供了可扩展且数据高效的范式。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

TL;DR: 提出LSEF框架，基于低秩稀疏原理将情感动态建模为层次化的低秩稀疏组合过程，通过三个模块分别捕获情感基座、分离瞬态波动并重建多尺度一致性，显著提升了视频情感计算的鲁棒性和动态判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频情感计算面临模型不稳定和表示退化问题，核心限制在于缺乏层次化结构机制来解耦不同的情感成分（情感基座和瞬态波动）。

Method: 提出LSEF框架，包含三个即插即用模块：稳定性编码模块捕获低秩情感基座，动态解耦模块分离稀疏瞬态信号，一致性集成模块重建多尺度稳定性与反应性一致性，采用秩感知优化策略自适应平衡梯度平滑性和敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证实，LSEF显著增强了鲁棒性和动态判别能力。

Conclusion: 验证了层次化低秩稀疏建模在理解情感动态方面的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统评估其在此任务上的能力。

Method: 提出三层次评估框架：粗粒度质量评分、中粒度失真类型识别、细粒度失真严重程度评估，并使用思维链提示进行改进。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs具有初步的DIQA能力，但存在评分不一致、失真误识别和严重程度误判等关键限制。思维链提示在所有层次上都显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为MLLMs的DIQA能力提供了基准测试，揭示了其在质量感知方面的明显缺陷，并指出了改进的可行路径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement. The benchmark and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA是一个用于类增量学习的新框架，通过将模型适配限制在CLIP的跨模态桥接层，使用正交低秩融合防止遗忘，并结合跨模态混合原型提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决将CLIP应用于类增量学习时的两个主要挑战：避免额外参数增加模型复杂度和遗忘风险，以及更有效地整合视觉和文本模态的互补优势。

Method: 在CLIP的跨模态桥接层进行适配，使用正交低秩融合机制将参数更新限制在低秩安全子空间，结合跨模态混合原型进行分类。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，BOFA相比现有方法实现了更高的准确率和效率。

Conclusion: BOFA框架通过限制适配范围、防止遗忘和有效整合多模态信息，为类增量学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视觉和脑电信号之间的根本不对称性，包括保真度差距（EEG噪声vs视觉高保真）和语义差距（EEG浅层概念vs视觉丰富语义），导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出自适应教学范式，通过ShrinkAdapter模块让视觉模态动态缩小和调整知识结构，采用无残差设计和瓶颈结构，使语义密集特征匹配脑电模态的容量。

Result: 在零样本脑到图像检索任务中达到60.2%的top-1准确率，比之前最优方法提升了9.8%。

Conclusion: 为不对称对齐引入了新视角：教师必须缩小和适应来弥合视觉-脑电差距。

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

Conclusion: WEAVE为研究上下文交织理解和生成提供了视角和基础，揭示了当前方法在多轮、上下文感知图像生成和编辑方面的持续局限性和挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估框架，用于区分文本到图像扩散模型中的识别（识别文化参考）和实现（如何描绘参考），重点关注多模态图标性现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊性，特别关注文化共享关联的多模态图标性案例。

Method: 引入分离识别和实现的评估框架，通过量化指标衡量两个维度，评估了5个扩散模型在767个维基数据文化参考上的表现，并进行提示扰动实验。

Result: 框架比现有基于相似性的方法更能有效区分复制与转换；模型即使文本线索改变也经常重现标志性视觉结构；文化对齐与训练数据频率、文本独特性、参考流行度和创建日期相关。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值不仅在于复制内容，更在于如何转换和重新语境化文化知识，推动评估从简单的文本-图像匹配向更丰富的语境理解发展。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM是一个受大脑启发的条件扩散框架，通过将fMRI信号按视觉皮层层次结构组织成多尺度金字塔，在图像重建中实现更好的语义理解和功能解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的脑活动解码器直接使用fMRI特征而不分析视觉信息在皮层中的组织方式，忽视了大脑的层次处理结构，无法区分早期、中期和晚期视觉区域的不同作用。

Method: 提出Hi-DREAM框架：1）ROI适配器将fMRI分组为早期/中期/晚期视觉流，转换为与U-Net深度对齐的多尺度皮层金字塔；2）轻量级深度匹配ControlNet在去噪过程中注入尺度特定提示。

Result: 在自然场景数据集上的实验表明，Hi-DREAM在高层次语义指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持竞争力的低层次保真度。

Conclusion: 按皮层层次结构组织条件信号是纯数据驱动嵌入的有力替代方案，为研究视觉皮层提供了有用的视角。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

Motivation: 现有的MLLMs缺乏对视觉提示（如边界框）理解能力的系统性评估，而这是人类用户自然的交互方式。

Method: 采用两阶段评估框架：第一阶段测试模型在自然场景中感知视觉提示的能力，使用30k个可视化提示，涵盖8种形状和355种属性组合；第二阶段评估视觉提示对下游任务的影响。

Result: 评估了28个MLLMs（包括GPT-4o、InternVL3和Qwen2.5-VL等），分析了影响视觉提示理解的因素，如属性变化、问题安排和模型规模。

Conclusion: VP-Bench为研究MLLMs如何理解和解决基于视觉提示的参考问题建立了新的参考框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

Conclusion: 通过控制合成数据生成过程，可以有效解决传统微调中的偏见和分布不平衡问题，显著提升视觉语言模型在真实世界任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnUNet-B是一个贝叶斯分割框架，通过多模态后验采样直接从H&E染色组织学图像推断PD-L1表达，在肺癌数据集上实现竞争性性能并提供像素级不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于免疫组织化学的PD-L1表达评估方法资源密集，需要开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 基于nnUNet-v2构建贝叶斯分割框架，在循环训练期间采样多样化模型检查点来近似后验分布，通过熵和标准差实现准确分割和认知不确定性估计。

Result: 在肺鳞状细胞癌数据集上，平均Dice分数为0.805，平均IoU为0.709，不确定性估计与分割误差强相关但校准仍不完美。

Conclusion: 基于H&E的不确定性感知PD-L1预测是向临床工作流程中可扩展、可解释生物标志物评估迈出的有希望的一步。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

*Nhat Hoang-Xuan,Minh Vu,My T. Thai,Manish Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的物体幻觉问题源于模型忽略图像而依赖先前生成的prelim tokens来推断新物体，提出了基于注意力权重的Prelim Attention Score（PAS）方法来实时检测和过滤幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然强大但存在物体幻觉问题，研究发现许多幻觉预测中模型实际上忽略了图像，而是依赖先前生成的prelim tokens来推断新物体。

Method: 通过计算图像与预测物体在给定prelim条件下的互信息来量化图像依赖性，并引入Prelim Attention Score（PAS）——一种基于prelim tokens注意力权重的轻量级、无需训练的信号。

Result: PAS在多个模型和数据集上实现了最先进的物体幻觉检测性能，能够实时进行过滤和干预，且无需额外前向传播计算。

Conclusion: PAS通过利用先前被忽视的prelim tokens注意力信号，为大型视觉语言模型的物体幻觉问题提供了一种有效的实时检测和缓解方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种轻量级的跨模态融合模块，通过在编码器顶部添加少量双向注意力层来对齐视觉和文本的隐藏状态，在保持编码器效率的同时提升多模态任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型要么在编码器早期融合特征，要么在后期比较池化嵌入，但两种模态的隐藏状态本身已包含丰富的结构信息，直接对齐这些状态是更自然的融合方式。

Method: 在视觉和文本编码器顶部添加少量仅跨模态的双向注意力层，将隐藏状态投影到共享空间进行跨模态注意力计算，并通过门控残差更新返回，使用简单稳定器改善对齐效果。

Result: 在标准检索、VQA和视觉推理基准测试中，BRIDGE优于可比视觉语言模型，同时保持了对比模型的双编码器效率。

Conclusion: BRIDGE提供了一种有效且高效的跨模态融合方法，编码器保持非因果性和强理解能力，生成任务通过可选解码器清晰解耦。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为注意力特征聚合（AFA）的轻量级可训练池化机制，用于解决预训练视觉表示在视觉扰动场景下缺乏鲁棒性的问题。AFA能够学习关注任务相关的视觉线索，忽略语义丰富的场景干扰物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉表示虽然强大，但可能编码大量任务无关的场景信息，导致训练出的视觉运动策略在面对域外视觉变化和干扰物时缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 通过注意力特征聚合（AFA）机制，这是一种轻量级的可训练池化方法，能够自然地学习关注任务相关的视觉线索，忽略场景干扰物，无需昂贵的数据集增强或PVR微调。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的广泛实验中，使用AFA训练的策略在存在视觉扰动的情况下显著优于标准池化方法。

Conclusion: 忽略无关视觉信息是部署鲁棒且可泛化的视觉运动策略的关键步骤。

Abstract: The adoption of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs), leveraging features from large-scale vision models, has become a popular paradigm for training visuomotor policies. However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies. Project Page: tsagkas.github.io/afa

Abstract: As social robots increasingly enter public environments, their acceptance depends not only on technical reliability but also on ethical integrity, accessibility, and user trust. This paper reports on a pilot deployment of an ARI social robot functioning as a university receptionist, designed in alignment with the SecuRoPS framework for secure and ethical social robot deployment. Thirty-five students and staff interacted with the robot and provided structured feedback on safety, privacy, usability, accessibility, and transparency. The results show generally positive perceptions of physical safety, data protection, and ethical behavior, while also highlighting challenges related to accessibility, inclusiveness, and dynamic interaction. Beyond the empirical findings, the study demonstrates how theoretical frameworks for ethical and secure design can be implemented in real-world contexts through end-user evaluation. It also provides a public GitHub repository containing reusable templates for ARI robot applications to support reproducibility and lower the entry barrier for new researchers. By combining user perspectives with practical technical resources, this work contributes to ongoing discussions in AI and society and supports the development of trustworthy, inclusive, and ethically responsible social robots for public spaces.

Motivation: 在搜索和救援场景中，由于信息不确定、观察者不完美和搜索区域大，搜索问题复杂。特别是在海上搜救等场景中，预期生存时间短，最优搜索可以提高成功概率。现有随机优化方法缺乏对有限时间内解质量的形式保证。

Conclusion: A^SAR算法为搜索和救援规划提供了一种具有形式保证的ε最优搜索方法，在模拟和实际应用中均表现出色。

Abstract: Searches are conducted to find missing persons and/or objects given uncertain information, imperfect observers and large search areas in Search and Rescue (SAR). In many scenarios, such as Maritime SAR, expected survival times are short and optimal search could increase the likelihood of success. This optimization problem is complex for nontrivial problems given its probabilistic nature.
  Stochastic optimization methods search large problems by nondeterministically sampling the space to reduce the effective size of the problem. This has been used in SAR planning to search otherwise intractably large problems but the stochastic nature provides no formal guarantees on the quality of solutions found in finite time.
  This paper instead presents $\rm{A}^{\rm{SAR}}$, an $\varepsilon$-optimal search algorithm for SAR planning. It calculates a heuristic to bound the search space and uses graph-search methods to find solutions that are formally guaranteed to be within a user-specified factor, $\varepsilon$, of the optimal solution. It finds better solutions faster than existing optimization approaches in operational simulations. It is also demonstrated with a real-world field trial on Lake Ontario, Canada, where it was used to locate a drifting manikin in only 150s.

Conclusion: 动态可伸缩机器人腿设计成功解决了搜救机器人对地形适应性和高力输出的双重需求，通过几何变换实现配置切换，为搜救机器人发展提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Search and rescue (SAR) robots are required to quickly traverse terrain and perform high-force rescue tasks, necessitating both terrain adaptability and controlled high-force output. Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability. The results demonstrate that the morphing leg offers a promising path toward SAR robots that can both navigate terrain quickly and perform rescue tasks effectively.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel decentralized approach for achieving emergent behavior in multi-agent systems with minimal information sharing. Based on prior work in simple orbits, our method produces a broad class of stable, periodic trajectories by stabilizing the system around a Lie group-based geometric embedding. Employing the Lie group SO(3), we generate a wider range of periodic curves than existing quaternion-based methods. Furthermore, we exploit SO(3) properties to eliminate the need for velocity inputs, allowing agents to receive only position inputs. We also propose a novel phase controller that ensures uniform agent separation, along with a formal stability proof. Validation through simulations and experiments showcases the method's adaptability to complex low-level dynamics and disturbances.

Abstract: Quantifying greenhouse-gases (GHG) in wetlands is critical for climate modeling and restoration assessment, yet manual sampling is labor-intensive, and time demanding. We present WetExplorer, an autonomous tracked robot that automates the full GHG-sampling workflow. The robot system integrates low-ground-pressure locomotion, centimeter-accurate lift placement, dual-RTK sensor fusion, obstacle avoidance planning, and deep-learning perception in a containerized ROS2 stack. Outdoor trials verified that the sensor-fusion stack maintains a mean localization error of 1.71 cm, the vision module estimates object pose with 7 mm translational and 3° rotational accuracy, while indoor trials demonstrated that the full motion-planning pipeline positions the sampling chamber within a global tolerance of 70 mm while avoiding obstacles, all without human intervention. By eliminating the manual bottleneck, WetExplorer enables high-frequency, multi-site GHG measurements and opens the door for dense, long-duration datasets in saturated wetland terrain.

Abstract: Most engineered pilings require substantially more force to be driven into the ground than they can resist during extraction. This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1.

Abstract: The inherent difficulty and limited scalability of collecting manipulation data using multi-fingered robot hand hardware platforms have resulted in severe data scarcity, impeding research on data-driven dexterous manipulation policy learning. To address this challenge, we present a hand-agnostic manipulation transfer system. It efficiently converts human hand manipulation sequences from demonstration videos into high-quality dexterous manipulation trajectories without requirements of massive training data. To tackle the multi-dimensional disparities between human hands and dexterous hands, as well as the challenges posed by high-degree-of-freedom coordinated control of dexterous hands, we design a progressive transfer framework: first, we establish primary control signals for dexterous hands based on kinematic matching; subsequently, we train residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to dynamically optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; finally, we compute wrist control trajectories with the objective of preserving operational semantics. Using only human hand manipulation videos, our system automatically configures system parameters for different tasks, balancing kinematic matching and dynamic optimization across dexterous hands, object categories, and tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can automatically generate smooth and semantically correct dexterous hand manipulation that faithfully reproduces human intentions, achieving high efficiency and strong generalizability with an average transfer success rate of 73%, providing an easily implementable and scalable method for collecting robot dexterous manipulation data.

Abstract: Coordination of movement and configuration in robotic swarms is a challenging endeavor. Deciding when and where each individual robot must move is a computationally complex problem. The challenge is further exacerbated by difficulties inherent to physical systems, such as measurement error and control dynamics. Thus, how to best determine the optimal path for each robot, when moving from one configuration to another, and how to best perform such determination and effect corresponding motion remains an open problem. In this paper, we show an algorithm for such coordination of robotic swarms. Our methods allow seamless transition from one configuration to another, leveraging geometric formulations that are mapped to the physical domain through appropriate control, localization, and mapping techniques. This paves the way for novel applications of robotic swarms by enabling more sophisticated distributed behaviors.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持最先进导航性能的同时，显著提高了计算效率，证明了在潜在空间中进行导航规划的可行性。

Abstract: Traditional navigation methods rely heavily on accurate localization and mapping. In contrast, world models that capture environmental dynamics in latent space have opened up new perspectives for navigation tasks, enabling systems to move beyond traditional multi-module pipelines. However, world model often suffers from high computational costs in both training and inference. To address this, we propose LS-NWM - a lightweight latent space navigation world model that is trained and operates entirely in latent space, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our method reduces training time by approximately 3.2x and planning time by about 447x,while further improving navigation performance with a 35% higher SR and an 11% higher SPL. The key idea is that accurate pixel-wise environmental prediction is unnecessary for navigation. Instead, the model predicts future latent states based on current observational features and action inputs, then performs path planning and decision-making within this compact representation, significantly improving computational efficiency. By incorporating an autoregressive multi-frame prediction strategy during training, the model effectively captures long-term spatiotemporal dependencies, thereby enhancing navigation performance in complex scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance while maintaining a substantial efficiency advantage over existing approaches.

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous driving, which extends vehicle autonomy by enabling real-time collaboration between vehicles and smart roadside infrastructure, remains a challenging yet essential problem. However, none of the existing testbeds employ smart infrastructure equipped with sensing, edge computing, and communication capabilities. To address this gap, we design and implement a 1:15-scale miniature testbed, CIVAT, for validating cooperative autonomous driving, consisting of a scaled urban map, autonomous vehicles with onboard sensors, and smart infrastructure. The proposed testbed integrates V2V and V2I communication with the publish-subscribe pattern through a shared Wi-Fi and ROS2 framework, enabling information exchange between vehicles and infrastructure to realize cooperative driving functionality. As a case study, we validate the system through infrastructure-based perception and intersection management experiments.

Conclusion: 混合抓取与非抓取操作是实现通用、人类水平机器人操作能力的重要步骤。

Abstract: Non-prehensile (NP) manipulation, in which robots alter object states without forming stable grasps (for example, pushing, poking, or sliding), significantly broadens robotic manipulation capabilities when grasping is infeasible or insufficient. However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. These results underscore the potential of hybrid P&NP manipulation as a crucial step toward general-purpose, human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界是动态的，准静态交互不足以应对各种环境条件。为了向更动态的交互场景迈进，需要开发能够处理动态交互的人形机器人控制器。

Method: 采用三阶段课程训练：首先获取步法，然后生成精确引导的球拍挥动，最后进行任务聚焦的细化。部署时使用扩展卡尔曼滤波器估计和预测羽毛球轨迹，并引入了无需预测的变体。

Result: 在仿真中，两个机器人连续击球21次；无需预测的变体实现了与目标已知策略相当的性能。真实世界测试中，击球速度达10 m/s，平均回球落点距离3.5米。

Conclusion: 该人形机器人能够在羽毛球中实现高度动态而精确的目标击球，并可适应更多对动态性要求高的领域。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have demonstrated strong capability for interacting with deterministic scenes across locomotion, manipulation, and more challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet the real world is dynamic, quasi-static interactions are insufficient to cope with the various environmental conditions. As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m. These experiment results show that our humanoid robot can deliver highly dynamic while precise goal striking in badminton, and can be adapted to more dynamism critical domains.

Abstract: Advanced robotic manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects remains one of the greatest challenges due to their pliancy, frailness, variability, and uncertainties during interaction. Motivated by these challenges, this article introduces Sashimi-Bot, an autonomous multi-robotic system for advanced manipulation and cutting, specifically the preparation of sashimi. The objects that we manipulate, salmon loins, are natural in origin and vary in size and shape, they are limp and deformable with poorly characterized elastoplastic parameters, while also being slippery and hard to hold. The three robots straighten the loin; grasp and hold the knife; cut with the knife in a slicing motion while cooperatively stabilizing the loin during cutting; and pick up the thin slices from the cutting board or knife blade. Our system combines deep reinforcement learning with in-hand tool shape manipulation, in-hand tool cutting, and feedback of visual and tactile information to achieve robustness to the variabilities inherent in this task. This work represents a milestone in robotic manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects that may inspire and enable a wide range of other real-world applications.

Abstract: Foundation models applied in robotics, particularly \textbf{Vision--Language--Action (VLA)} models, hold great promise for achieving general-purpose manipulation. Yet, systematic real-world evaluations and cross-model comparisons remain scarce. This paper reports our \textbf{empirical experiences} from benchmarking four representative VLAs -- \textbf{ACT}, \textbf{OpenVLA--OFT}, \textbf{RDT-1B}, and \boldmath{$π_0$} -- across four manipulation tasks conducted in both simulation and on the \textbf{ALOHA Mobile} platform. We establish a \textbf{standardized evaluation framework} that measures performance along three key dimensions: (1) \textit{accuracy and efficiency} (success rate and time-to-success), (2) \textit{adaptability} across in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, and instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution settings, and (3) \textit{language instruction-following accuracy}. Through this process, we observe that \boldmath{$π_0$} demonstrates superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while \textbf{ACT} provides the highest stability in-distribution. Further analysis highlights differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and recurring failure modes such as near-miss grasps, premature releases, and long-horizon state drift. These findings reveal practical trade-offs among VLA model architectures in balancing precision, generalization, and deployment cost, offering actionable insights for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous racing offers a rigorous setting to stress test perception, planning, and control under high speed and uncertainty. This paper proposes an approach to design and evaluate a software stack for an autonomous race car in CARLA: Car Learning to Act simulator, targeting competitive driving performance in the Formula Student UK Driverless (FS-AI) 2025 competition. By utilizing a 360° light detection and ranging (LiDAR), stereo camera, global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor via ROS 2 (Robot Operating System), the system reliably detects the cones marking the track boundaries at distances of up to 35 m. Optimized trajectories are computed considering vehicle dynamics and simulated environmental factors such as visibility and lighting to navigate the track efficiently. The complete autonomous stack is implemented in ROS 2 and validated extensively in CARLA on a dedicated vehicle (ADS-DV) before being ported to the actual hardware, which includes the Jetson AGX Orin 64GB, ZED2i Stereo Camera, Robosense Helios 16P LiDAR, and CHCNAV Inertial Navigation System (INS).

Abstract: The "Vision Zero" policy, introduced by the Swedish Parliament in 1997, aims to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries resulting from traffic accidents. To achieve this goal, the use of self-driving vehicles in traffic is envisioned and a roadmap for the certification of self-driving vehicles is aimed to be determined. However, it is still unclear how the basic safety requirements that autonomous vehicles must meet will be verified and certified, and which methods will be used.

It examines the prominent methods used in the certification process, develops a pipeline for the certification process of autonomous vehicles, and determines the stages, actors, and areas where the addressed methods can be applied.

Conclusion: TLV-CoRe通过传感器感知调制、触觉无关解耦学习和统一桥接适配器，有效解决了触觉传感器标准化和多模态融合问题，在鲁棒性、协同性和稳定性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Tactile sensing offers rich and complementary information to vision and language, enabling robots to perceive fine-grained object properties. However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.

Abstract: Coverage motion planning is essential to a wide range of robotic tasks. Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This paper focuses on the advantages of this formulation in terms of scalability through parallelization, highlighting its computational benefits compared to conventional methods based on waypoint tracking.

Abstract: Training generalist policies for robotic manipulation has shown great promise, as they enable language-conditioned, multi-task behaviors across diverse scenarios. However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation. Our paper examines the effect of dataset diversity, pre-trained weight and common failure cases for the proposed evaluation pipeline.Our experiments demonstrate that, across various metrics, including policy ranking and the correlation between actual policy values and predicted policy values, these models offer a promising approach for evaluating policies without requiring real-world interactions.

Abstract: Successful autonomous robot navigation in off-road domains requires the ability to generate high-quality terrain costmaps that are able to both generalize well over a wide variety of terrains and rapidly adapt relative costs at test time to meet mission-specific needs. Existing approaches for costmap generation allow for either rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs (e.g., semantic segmentation methods) or generalization to new terrain types (e.g., representation learning methods), but not both. In this work, we present scaled preference conditioned all-terrain costmap generation (SPACER), a novel approach for generating terrain costmaps that leverages synthetic data during training in order to generalize well to new terrains, and allows for rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs by conditioning on a user-specified scaled preference context. Using large-scale aerial maps, we provide empirical evidence that SPACER outperforms other approaches at generating costmaps for terrain navigation, with the lowest measured regret across varied preferences in five of seven environments for global path planning.
