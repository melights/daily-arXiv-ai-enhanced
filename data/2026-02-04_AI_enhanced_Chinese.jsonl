Recent generative models promise end-to-end synthesis, but their reliance on unstructured noise priors often yields unsafe, inefficient, or unimodal plans that cannot meet real-time requirements. We propose StepNav, a novel framework that bridges this gap by introducing structured, multimodal trajectory priors derived from variational principles. StepNav first learns a geometry-aware success probability field to identify all feasible navigation corridors. These corridors are then used to construct an explicit, multi-modal mixture prior that initializes a conditional flow-matching process. This refinement is formulated as an optimal control problem with explicit smoothness and safety regularization. By replacing unstructured noise with physically-grounded candidates, StepNav generates safer and more efficient plans in significantly fewer steps. Experiments in both simulation and real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in robustness, efficiency, and safety over state-of-the-art generative planners, advancing reliable trajectory generation for practical autonomous navigation.

To support consistent performance evaluation, a Race Monitor framework is introduced as a lightweight system through which lap timing, trajectory quality, and computational load are logged in real time and standardized post-race analyses are generated. AROLA is validated in simulation and on hardware using the RoboRacer platform, including deployment at the 2025 RoboRacer IV25 competition.

Existing approaches often rely on prior knowledge about the objects, such as the number or type of joints. Some of these approaches also fail to recover occluded joints that are only revealed during interaction. Others require large numbers of multi-view images for every object, which is impractical in real-world settings. Furthermore, prior works neglect the order of manipulations, which is essential for many multi-DoF objects where one joint must be operated before another, such as a dishwasher. We introduce PokeNet, an end-to-end framework that estimates articulation models from a single human demonstration without prior object knowledge. Given a sequence of point cloud observations of a human manipulating an unknown object, PokeNet predicts joint parameters, infers manipulation order, and tracks joint states over time. PokeNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, improving joint axis and state estimation accuracy by an average of over 27% across diverse objects, including novel and unseen categories.

We develop a pair of custom, fabric-integrated HDEMG forearm sleeves, worn on both arms, that capture residual neuromotor activity from clinically paralyzed degrees of freedom and support real-time gesture-based robot control. Second, by integrating vision, language, and motion planning modules, we introduce a shared autonomy framework that supports robust and user-driven teleoperation, with particular benefits for navigation-intensive tasks in home environments. Finally, to demonstrate the system in the wild, we present a twelve-day in-home user study evaluating real-time use of the wearable EMG interface for daily robot control.

However, existing evaluations rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of difficulty relative to varying model capacities. Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that while adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity, it notably decouples from final accuracy. Conversely, key step coverage aligns with performance, though tool effectiveness remains highly inconsistent across model architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdaptMMBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u548cMCC\u6307\u6807\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u96be\u5ea6\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u96be\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaAdaptMMBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u3001OCR\u3001GUI\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u6570\u5b66\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u76f4\u63a5\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4f7f\u7528MCC\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u652f\u6301\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u95f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaptMMBench\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Evans", "Dylan P. Losey", "Simon Stepputtis"], "title": "Language Movement Primitives: Grounding Language Models in Robot Motion", "comment": null, "summary": "Enabling robots to perform novel manipulation tasks from natural language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, despite significant progress in generalized problem solving with foundational models. Large vision and language models (VLMs) are capable of processing high-dimensional input data for visual scene and language understanding, as well as decomposing tasks into a sequence of logical steps; however, they struggle to ground those steps in embodied robot motion. On the other hand, robotics foundation models output action commands, but require in-domain fine-tuning or experience before they are able to perform novel tasks successfully. At its core, there still remains the fundamental challenge of connecting abstract task reasoning with low-level motion control. To address this disconnect, we propose Language Movement Primitives (LMPs), a framework that grounds VLM reasoning in Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) parameterization. Our key insight is that DMPs provide a small number of interpretable parameters, and VLMs can set these parameters to specify diverse, continuous, and stable trajectories. Put another way: VLMs can reason over free-form natural language task descriptions, and semantically ground their desired motions into DMPs -- bridging the gap between high-level task reasoning and low-level position and velocity control. Building on this combination of VLMs and DMPs, we formulate our LMP pipeline for zero-shot robot manipulation that effectively completes tabletop manipulation problems by generating a sequence of DMP motions. Across 20 real-world manipulation tasks, we show that LMP achieves 80% task success as compared to 31% for the best-performing baseline.

However, because self-attention operates globally, they lack an explicit mechanism to distinguish foreground from background. As a result, ViT may learn unnecessary background features and artifacts, leading to degraded classification performance. To address this issue, we propose SVD-ViT, which leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to prioritize the learning of foreground features. SVD-ViT consists of three components-\\textbf{SPC module}, \\textbf{SSVA}, and \\textbf{ID-RSVD}-and suppresses task-irrelevant factors such as background noise and artifacts by extracting and aggregating singular vectors that capture object foreground information.

Traditional manual landmarking is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while rule-based methods are often tailored to specific geometries or limited sets of landmarks. In recent years, anatomical surfaces have been effectively represented as point clouds, which are lightweight structures composed of spatial coordinates. Following this strategy and to overcome the limitations of existing landmarking techniques, we propose Landmark Point Transformer (LmPT), a method for automatic anatomical landmark detection on point clouds that can leverage homologous bones from different species for translational research. The LmPT model incorporates a conditioning mechanism that enables adaptability to different input types to conduct cross-species learning.

Effective anonymization relies on the exhaustive localization of every individual; even a single missed detection necessitates extensive manual correction. However, existing approaches face two critical scalability bottlenecks: (1) they usually require manual annotations of each new clinical site for high accuracy; (2) while multi-camera setups have been widely adopted to address single-view ambiguity, camera calibration is typically required whenever cameras are repositioned. To address these problems, we propose a novel self-supervised multi-view video anonymization framework consisting of whole-body person detection and whole-body pose estimation, without annotation or camera calibration. Our core strategy is to enhance the single-view detector by \"retrieving\" false negatives using temporal and multi-view context, and conducting self-supervised domain adaptation. We first run an off-the-shelf whole-body person detector in each view with a low-score threshold to gather candidate detections. Then, we retrieve the low-score false negatives that exhibit consistency with the high-score detections via tracking and self-supervised uncalibrated multi-view association. These recovered detections serve as pseudo labels to iteratively fine-tune the whole-body detector. Finally, we apply whole-body pose estimation on each detected person, and fine-tune the pose model using its own high-score predictions. Experiments on the 4D-OR dataset of simulated surgeries and our dataset of real surgeries show the effectiveness of our approach achieving over 97% recall. Moreover, we train a real-time whole-body detector using our pseudo labels, achieving comparable performance and highlighting our method's practical applicability.

We introduce a contrastive, document-aware reference selection framework that constructs compact evidence sets optimized for discrimination rather than similarity by explicitly balancing visual relevance, embedding diversity, and source-level provenance using ROCO embeddings and metadata. While ROCO provides large-scale image-caption pairs, it does not specify how references should be selected for contrastive reasoning, and naive retrieval frequently yields near-duplicate figures from the same document. To address this gap, we release a reproducible reference selection protocol and curated reference bank that enable a systematic study of contrastive retrieval in medical image reasoning. Building on these contrastive evidence sets, we propose Counterfactual-Contrastive Inference, a confidence-aware reasoning framework that performs structured pairwise visual comparisons and aggregates evidence using margin-based decision rules with faithful abstention. On the MediConfusion benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving set-level accuracy by nearly 15% relative to prior methods while reducing confusion and improving individual accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u6587\u6863\u611f\u77e5\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u533a\u5206\u6613\u6df7\u6dc6\u75c5\u75c7\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u51b3\u7b56\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6613\u6df7\u6dc6\u75c5\u75c7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u89c6\u89c9\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd4\u56de\u5197\u4f59\u8bc1\u636e\u5e76\u5f3a\u5316\u5355\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f3c\u75c5\u75c7\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u6587\u6863\u611f\u77e5\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6765\u6e90\u7ea7\u6eaf\u6e90\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u7cbe\u9009\u53c2\u8003\u5e93\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc1\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u51faCounterfactual-Contrastive Inference\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6210\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc1\u636e\u805a\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728MediConfusion\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c06\u96c6\u5408\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd115%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6df7\u6dc6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e2a\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533a\u5206\u6613\u6df7\u6dc6\u75c5\u75c7\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Maintaining safe operation under impairment to achieve task completion, i.e. fail-active operation, is our target. Focusing on actuation failures, we introduce DEFT, a diffusion-based trajectory generator conditioned on the robot's current embodiment and task constraints. DEFT generalizes across failure types, supports constrained and unconstrained motions, and enables task completion under arbitrary failure. We evaluated DEFT in both simulation and real-world scenarios using a 7-DoF robotic arm. In simulation over thousands of joint-failure cases across multiple tasks, DEFT outperformed the baseline by up to 2 times. On failures unseen during training, it continued to outperform the baseline, indicating robust generalization in simulation. Further, we performed real-world evaluations on two multi-step tasks, drawer manipulation and whiteboard erasing. These experiments demonstrated DEFT succeeding on tasks where classical methods failed. Our results show that DEFT achieves fail-active manipulation across arbitrary failure configurations and real-world deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "DEFT\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5668\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bb9\u9519\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u6545\u969c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6545\u969c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u53d7\u635f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5373\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bb9\u9519\u64cd\u4f5c", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDEFT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f53\u524d\u672c\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u975e\u7ea6\u675f\u8fd0\u52a8", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u5173\u8282\u6545\u969c\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0cDEFT\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53472\u500d\uff1b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6545\u969c\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u62bd\u5c49\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u767d\u677f\u64e6\u9664\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cDEFT\u6210\u529f\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u8d25", "conclusion": "DEFT\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u6545\u969c\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bb9\u9519\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

We present FaceLinkGen, an identity extraction attack that performs linkage/matching and face regeneration directly from protected templates without recovering original pixels. On three recent PPFR systems, FaceLinkGen reaches over 98.5\\% matching accuracy and above 96\\% regeneration success, and still exceeds 92\\% matching and 94\\% regeneration in a near zero knowledge setting.

The system consists of truss-like robotic triangles formed by continuous inflated fabric tubes routed through two robotic roller units and a connecting unit. A newly developed spherical joint enables up to three triangles to connect at a vertex, allowing construction of truss assemblies beyond a single octahedron. When deflated, the triangles compact to approximately the volume of the roller units, achieving a stowed-to-deployed volume ratio of 1:18.3. Upon inflation, the roller units pinch the tubes, locally reducing bending stiffness to form effective joints. Electric motors then translate the roller units along the tube, shifting the pinch point by lengthening one edge while shortening another at the same rate, thereby preserving a constant perimeter (isoperimetric).

Variations in dynamics, degrees of freedom (DoFs), and kinematic topology still hinder a single policy from commanding diverse humanoids. Moreover, obtaining a generalist policy that not only transfers across embodiments but also supports richer behaviors-beyond simple walking to squatting, leaning-remains especially challenging. In this work, we tackle these obstacles by introducing EAGLE, an iterative generalist-specialist distillation framework that produces a single unified policy that controls multiple heterogeneous humanoids without per-robot reward tuning. During each cycle, embodiment-specific specialists are forked from the current generalist, refined on their respective robots, and new skills are distilled back into the generalist by training on the pooled embodiment set. Repeating this loop until performance convergence produces a robust Whole-Body Controller validated on robots such as Unitree H1, G1, and Fourier N1. We conducted experiments on five different robots in simulation and four in real-world settings. Through quantitative evaluations, EAGLE achieves high tracking accuracy and robustness compared to other methods, marking a step toward scalable, fleet-level humanoid control.

The reason being that synthetic and real medical images exist in different semantic feature spaces, creating a domain gap that current semi-supervised learning methods cannot bridge. We propose SRA-Seg, a framework explicitly designed to align synthetic and real feature distributions for medical image segmentation. SRA-Seg introduces a similarity-alignment (SA) loss using frozen DINOv2 embeddings to pull synthetic representations toward their nearest real counterparts in semantic space. We employ soft edge blending to create smooth anatomical transitions and continuous labels, eliminating the hard boundaries from traditional copy-paste augmentation. The framework generates pseudo-labels for synthetic images via an EMA teacher model and applies soft-segmentation losses that respect uncertainty in mixed regions. Our experiments demonstrate strong results: using only 10% labeled real data and 90% synthetic unlabeled data, SRA-Seg achieves 89.34% Dice on ACDC and 84.42% on FIVES, significantly outperforming existing semi-supervised methods and matching the performance of methods using real unlabeled data.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRA-Seg\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ec5\u752810%\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c90%\u5408\u6210\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u903c\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f53\u524d\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSRA-Seg\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684DINOv2\u5d4c\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2\uff09\u8f6f\u8fb9\u7f18\u6df7\u5408\u6280\u672f\u521b\u5efa\u5e73\u6ed1\u89e3\u5256\u8fc7\u6e21\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7EMA\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b4\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u8003\u8651\u6df7\u5408\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8f6f\u5206\u5272\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752810%\u6807\u6ce8\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u548c90%\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cSRA-Seg\u5728ACDC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523089.34% Dice\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5728FIVES\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523084.42% Dice\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "SRA-Seg\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To tackle this challenge, we propose RPL, a two-stage training framework that enables multi-directional locomotion on challenging terrains, and remains robust with payloads. RPL first trains terrain-specific expert policies with privileged height map observations to master decoupled locomotion and manipulation skills across different terrains, and then distills them into a transformer policy that leverages multiple depth cameras to cover a wide range of views. During distillation, we introduce two techniques to robustify multi-directional locomotion, depth feature scaling based on velocity commands and random side masking, which are critical for asymmetric depth observations and unseen widths of terrains. For scalable depth distillation, we develop an efficient multi-depth system that ray-casts against both dynamic robot meshes and static terrain meshes in massively parallel environments, achieving a 5-times speedup over the depth rendering pipelines in existing simulators while modeling realistic sensor latency, noise, and dropout. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate robust multi-directional locomotion with payloads (2kg) across challenging terrains, including 20\u00b0 slopes, staircases with different step lengths (22 cm, 25 cm, 30 cm), and 25 cm by 25 cm stepping stones separated by 60 cm gaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "RPL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u548cTransformer\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u4eba\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u8fd0\u52a8\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u6743\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5730\u5f62\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u638c\u63e1\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u968f\u673a\u4fa7\u5411\u63a9\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6df1\u5ea6\u76f8\u673a\u7684Transformer\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6df1\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u7ebf\u6295\u5c04\u5b9e\u73b05\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d2kg\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7a7f\u8d8a\u591a\u79cd\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5730\u5f62\uff0c\u5305\u62ec20\u00b0\u659c\u5761\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u957f\uff0822cm\u300125cm\u300130cm\uff09\u7684\u697c\u68af\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u95f4\u969460cm\u768425cm\u00d725cm\u8e0f\u811a\u77f3\u3002", "conclusion": "RPL\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5730\u5f62\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A typical primary search involves quickly and thoroughly looking for victims under hazardous conditions and monitoring flammable materials. However, situational awareness in complex indoor environments and rapid stair climbing across different staircases remain the main challenges for robot-assisted primary searches. In this project, we designed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize both navigation and locomotion. In the first stage, the quadrupeds, Unitree Go2, were trained to climb stairs in Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain. In the second stage, the quadrupeds were trained to climb various realistic indoor staircases in the Isaac Lab engine, with the learned policy transferred from the previous stage. These indoor staircases are straight, L-shaped, and spiral, to support climbing tasks in complex environments. This project explores how to balance navigation and locomotion and how end-to-end RL methods can enable quadrupeds to adapt to different stair shapes. Our main contributions are: (1) A two-stage end-to-end RL framework that transfers stair-climbing skills from abstract pyramid terrain to realistic indoor stair topologies.

Both candidate types are jointly scored by a shared selection module, enabling reliable performance across routine and highly interactive scenarios.

During the surgery, a surgeon holds tweezers and a dissector to delicately strip the blockage, but available tools for this surgery are rigid and straight, lacking distal dexterity to access into thin branches of PA. Therefore, this work presents a novel robotized dissector based on concentric push/pull robot (CPPR) structure, enabling entering deep thin branch of tortuous PA. Compared with conventional rigid dissectors, our design characterizes slenderness and dual-segment-bending dexterity. Owing to the hollow and thin-walled structure of the CPPR-based dissector as it has a slender body of 3.5mm in diameter, the central lumen accommodates two channels for irrigation and tip tool, and space for endoscopic camera's signal wire. To provide accurate surgical manipulation, optimization-based kinematics model was established, realizing a 2mm accuracy in positioning the tip tool (60mm length) under open-loop control strategy.

Attackers can pretrain VLAs on poisoned data to implant backdoors that remain stealthy but can trigger harmful behavior during inference. However, existing defenses either lack mechanistic insight into multimodal backdoors or impose prohibitive computational costs via full-model retraining. To this end, we uncover a deep-layer attention grabbing mechanism: backdoors redirect late-stage attention and form compact embedding clusters near the clean manifold. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Bera, a test-time backdoor erasure framework that detects tokens with anomalous attention via latent-space localization, masks suspicious regions using deep-layer cues, and reconstructs a trigger-free image to break the trigger-unsafe-action mapping while restoring correct behavior. Unlike prior defenses, Bera requires neither retraining of VLAs nor any changes to the training pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple embodied platforms and tasks show that Bera effectively maintains nominal performance, significantly reduces attack success rates, and consistently restores benign behavior from backdoored outputs, thereby offering a robust and practical defense mechanism for securing robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bera\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u64e6\u9664\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u5c4f\u853d\u53ef\u7591\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\u65e0\u89e6\u53d1\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u9632\u5fa1\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u540e\u95e8\u7684\u673a\u7406\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8", "method": "\u53d1\u73b0\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6293\u53d6\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u540e\u95e8\u4f1a\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u540e\u671f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e76\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6d41\u5f62\u9644\u8fd1\u5f62\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u5d4c\u5165\u7c07\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51faBera\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5c42\u7ebf\u7d22\u5c4f\u853d\u53ef\u7591\u533a\u57df\uff1b3\uff09\u91cd\u5efa\u65e0\u89e6\u53d1\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u6253\u7834\u89e6\u53d1-\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u52a8\u4f5c\u6620\u5c04", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u8eab\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBera\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4ece\u540e\u95e8\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u826f\u6027\u884c\u4e3a", "conclusion": "Bera\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4fee\u6539\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5b9e\u7528\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Despite their clinical relevance, the use of GRF remains underutilised in clinical workflows due to the practical limitations of force plate systems. In this work, we present a force-plate-free approach for estimating GRFs using only marker-based motion capture data. This kinematics only method to estimate and decompose GRF makes it well suited for widespread clinical depolyment. By using kinematics from sixteen body segments, we estimate the centre of mass (CoM) and compute GRFs, which are subsequently decomposed into individual components through a minimization-based approach. Through this framework, we can identify gait stance phases and provide access to clinically meaningful kinetic measures without a dedicated force plate system. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of CoM and GRF estimation based solely on kinematic data, supporting force-plate-free gait analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u7b97\u5730\u9762\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u7528\u6d4b\u529b\u53f0\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72", "motivation": "\u5730\u9762\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u5728\u6b65\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6d4b\u529b\u53f0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528", "method": "\u4f7f\u752816\u4e2a\u8eab\u4f53\u8282\u6bb5\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u7b97\u8d28\u5fc3\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5730\u9762\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5404\u5206\u91cf", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u7b97\u8d28\u5fc3\u548c\u5730\u9762\u53cd\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u6d4b\u529b\u53f0\u7684\u6b65\u6001\u5206\u6790", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u6b65\u6001\u652f\u6491\u76f8\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u6d4b\u529b\u53f0\u7684\u6b65\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6848"}}

Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains.

We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding. Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior. Experiments show that hierarchical cross-domain alignment enables fine-grained, visually grounded image-text representations to emerge without explicit region-level supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAFT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u57df\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u7ec6\u5230\u7c97\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u6587\u672cTransformer\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u957f\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u9700\u8981\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u57df\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u8a00\u5c42\u6b21\uff08\u53e5\u6cd5/\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f88\u5c11\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u5c42\u6b21\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u5916\u89c2\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u7126\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCAFT\uff08\u8de8\u57df\u68ee\u6797\u4e0e\u6811\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8026\u5408\u7ec6\u5230\u7c97\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u5c42\u6b21\u6587\u672cTransformer\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u6574\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6574\u4e2a\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u504f\u7f6e\u533a\u57df-\u53e5\u5b50\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b3\uff09\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u4ece\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc1\u636e\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8131\u79bb\u90e8\u5206\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u805a\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u57283000\u4e07\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cCAFT\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u957f\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c42\u6b21\u8de8\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u826f\u597d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "CAFT\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u8de8\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To improve data efficiency and adaptability, this study proposes a hierarchical IL framework that integrates motion primitives with proportion-based motion synthesis. The proposed method employs a two-layer architecture, where the upper layer performs long-term planning, while a set of lower-layer models learn individual motion primitives, which are combined according to specific proportions. Three model variants are introduced to explore different trade-offs between learning flexibility, computational cost, and adaptability: a learning-based proportion model, a sampling-based proportion model, and a playback-based proportion model, which differ in how the proportions are determined and whether the upper layer is trainable. Through real-robot pick-and-place experiments, the proposed models successfully generated complex motions not included in the primitive set.

Recent progress in Gaussian-based representations has significantly improved real-time rendering quality, yet existing methods still struggle to maintain a balance between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in both representation and optimization. To address this, we present SharpTimeGS, a lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of both static and dynamic regions under a unified representation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable lifespan parameter that reformulates temporal visibility from a Gaussian-shaped decay into a flat-top profile, allowing primitives to remain consistently active over their intended duration and avoiding redundant densification. In addition, the learned lifespan modulates each primitives' motion, reducing drift in long-lived static points while retaining unrestricted motion for short-lived dynamic ones. This effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity. Moreover, we design a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy that mitigates optimization imbalance between static and dynamic regions by allocating more capacity to regions with pronounced motion while keeping static areas compact and stable.

In this paper, we address humanoid skateboarding, a highly challenging task requiring stable dynamic maneuvering on an underactuated wheeled platform. This integrated system is governed by non-holonomic constraints and tightly coupled human-object interactions. Successfully executing this task requires simultaneous mastery of hybrid contact dynamics and robust balance control on a mechanically coupled, dynamically unstable skateboard. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose HUSKY, a learning-based framework that integrates humanoid-skateboard system modeling and physics-aware whole-body control. We first model the coupling relationship between board tilt and truck steering angles, enabling a principled analysis of system dynamics. Building upon this, HUSKY leverages Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to learn human-like pushing motions and employs a physics-guided, heading-oriented strategy for lean-to-steer behaviors. Moreover, a trajectory-guided mechanism ensures smooth and stable transitions between pushing and steering. Experimental results on the Unitree G1 humanoid platform demonstrate that our framework enables stable and agile maneuvering on skateboards in real-world scenarios.

We propose Video-OPD, an efficient post-training framework for TVG inspired by recent advances in on-policy distillation. Video-OPD optimizes trajectories sampled directly from the current policy, thereby preserving alignment between training and inference distributions, while a frontier teacher supplies dense, token-level supervision via a reverse KL divergence objective. This formulation preserves the on-policy property critical for mitigating distributional shift, while converting sparse, episode-level feedback into fine-grained, step-wise learning signals. Building on Video-OPD, we introduce Teacher-Validated Disagreement Focusing (TVDF), a lightweight training curriculum that iteratively prioritizes trajectories that are both teacher-reliable and maximally informative for the student, thereby improving training efficiency.

Recent advances in monocular depth estimation have demonstrated the potential of low-cost cameras as depth sensors; however, their adoption in field robotics remains limited due to the absence of reliable scale cues, ambiguous or low-texture conditions, and the scarcity of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a depth completion model that trains on synthetic data and uses extremely sparse measurements from depth sensors to predict dense metric depth in unseen field robotics environments. A synthetic dataset generation pipeline tailored to field robotics enables the creation of multiple realistic datasets for training purposes.

We introduce VOILA, a framework for Value-Of-Information-driven adaptive fidelity selection in Visual Question Answering (VQA) that optimizes what information to retrieve before model execution. Given a query, VOILA uses a two-stage pipeline: a gradient-boosted regressor estimates correctness likelihood at each fidelity from question features alone, then an isotonic calibrator refines these probabilities for reliable decision-making. The system selects the minimum-cost fidelity maximizing expected utility given predicted accuracy and retrieval costs. We evaluate VOILA across three deployment scenarios using five datasets (VQA-v2, GQA, TextVQA, LoCoMo, FloodNet) and six Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with 7B-235B parameters. VOILA consistently achieves 50-60% cost reductions while retaining 90-95% of full-resolution accuracy across diverse query types and model architectures, demonstrating that pre-retrieval fidelity selection is vital to optimize multimodal inference under resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "VOILA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u630190-95%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1150-60%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9ad8\u6602\u6210\u672c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u9700\u6c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "VOILA\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u4ec5\u4ece\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5f81\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6982\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u6e17\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u7387\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7ed9\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u3001\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08VQA-v2\u3001GQA\u3001TextVQA\u3001LoCoMo\u3001FloodNet\uff09\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4ece7B\u5230235B\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cVOILA\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b050-60%\u7684\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630190-95%\u7684\u5168\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u68c0\u7d22\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cVOILA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

We characterize the sensing behavior of this omnidirectional radar arrangement in power line environments and develop a robust detection-and-avoidance algorithm tailored to that behavior.

Recent studies intuitively identify the high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture to be extracted by CNNs from the encoder, and subsequently for a desirable upsampling recovery. However, the existing arts inevitably overlook the information loss for both structure and texture feature maps during the convolutional downsampling process, hence suffer from a non-ideal upsampling output. In this paper, we systematically answer whether and how the structure and texture feature map can mutually help to alleviate the information loss during the convolutional downsampling. Given the structure and texture feature maps, we adopt the statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for the reconstruction guidance during the convolutional downsampling process. The extensive experimental results validate its advantages to the state-of-the-arts over the images from low-to-high resolutions including 256*256 and 512*512, especially holds by substituting all the encoders by ours.

Optical tactile sensors have emerged as promising solutions, as they are immune to electromagnetic interference and have high spatial resolution. However, existing optical approaches, particularly vision-based tactile sensors, rely on complex optical assemblies that involve lenses and cameras, resulting in bulky, rigid, and alignment-sensitive designs. In this study, we present a thin, compact, and soft optical tactile sensor featuring an alignment-free configuration. The soft optical sensor operates by capturing deformation-induced changes in speckle patterns generated within a soft silicone material, thereby enabling precise force measurements and texture recognition via machine learning. The experimental results show a root-mean-square error of 40 mN in the force measurement and a classification accuracy of 93.33% over nine classes of textured surfaces, including Mahjong tiles. The proposed speckle-based approach provides a compact, easily fabricated, and mechanically compliant platform that bridges optical sensing with flexible shape-adaptive architectures, thereby demonstrating its potential as a novel tactile-sensing paradigm for soft robotics and wearable haptic interfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6563\u6591\u56fe\u6848\u7684\u8584\u578b\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u67d4\u8f6f\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u5149\u5b66\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5149\u5b66\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u900f\u955c\u548c\u76f8\u673a\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f53\u79ef\u5e9e\u5927\u3001\u521a\u6027\u4e14\u5bf9\u6821\u51c6\u654f\u611f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u67d4\u8f6f\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6563\u6591\u56fe\u6848\u7684\u67d4\u8f6f\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u8f6f\u7845\u80f6\u6750\u6599\u5185\u53d8\u5f62\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6563\u6591\u56fe\u6848\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a40 mN\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e5d\u7c7b\u7eb9\u7406\u8868\u9762\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u9ebb\u5c06\u724c\uff09\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523093.33%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6563\u6591\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u6613\u4e8e\u5236\u9020\u3001\u673a\u68b0\u67d4\u987a\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5c06\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u67d4\u6027\u5f62\u72b6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u89e6\u89c9\u754c\u9762\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We address this inherent limitation by selectively regularizing such geometries into strictly convex implicit representations, restoring uniqueness and smoothness of the contact map. Leveraging this geometric regularization, we develop iDCOL, an implicit differentiable collision detection and contact kinematics framework. iDCOL represents colliding bodies using strictly convex implicit surfaces and computes collision detection and contact kinematics by solving a fixed-size nonlinear system derived from a geometric scaling-based convex optimization formulation. By applying the Implicit Function Theorem to the resulting system residual, we derive analytical derivatives of the contact kinematic quantities. We develop a fast Newton-based solver for iDCOL and provide an open-source C++ implementation of the framework.

Existing approaches typically rely on feed-forward pipelines or prompt-only refinement, which often leads to semantic drift and identity inconsistency as sequences grow longer. We address this challenge by formulating storytelling as a closed-loop constraint enforcement problem and propose MUSE, a multi-agent framework that coordinates generation through an iterative plan-execute-verify-revise loop.

To achieve this, we collected one of the largest open-source robotic datasets--over 10,000 hours of demonstrations in diverse families--using an enhanced, embodiment-agnostic Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI). Our approach employs a novel three-stage training recipe that aligns discrete linguistic knowledge with continuous control via Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), flow-matching, and distillation for real-time inference. Consequently, RDT2 becomes one of the first models that simultaneously zero-shot generalizes to unseen objects, scenes, instructions, and even robotic platforms.

Many existing approaches rely on point contact models due to their computational effi- ciency. Simple contact models are computationally efficient but inherently limited for achieving human-like, contact-rich ma- nipulation, as they fail to capture key frictional dynamics and torque generation observed in human manipulation. This study introduces a Force-Distributed Line Contact (FDLC) model in contact-rich manipulation and compares it against conventional point contact models. A bi-level optimization framework is constructed, in which the lower-level solves an optimization problem for contact force computation, and the upper-level optimization applies iLQR for trajectory optimization. Through this framework, the limitations of point contact are demon- strated, and the benefits of the FDLC in generating efficient and robust trajectories are established. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by a box rotating task, demonstrating that FDLC enables trajectories generated via non-uniform force distributions along the contact line, while requiring lower control effort and less motion of the robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u7ebf\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u70b9\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u70b9\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6469\u64e6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u626d\u77e9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u7ebf\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e0b\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0a\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u7528iLQR\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d2\u5b50\u65cb\u8f6c\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "FDLC\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6cbf\u63a5\u89e6\u7ebf\u975e\u5747\u5300\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u70b9\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u52aa\u529b\u548c\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ebf\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u7ebf\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u70b9\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To alleviate these challenges, we present the Learning-based Active Stabilization on Moving Platforms (\\textit{LAS-MP}), featuring a self-balancing policy and system state estimators. The policy adaptively adjusts the robot's posture in response to the platform's motion. The estimators infer robot and platform states based on proprioceptive sensor data.

A significant challenge, however, is their prohibitive inference cost when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods that primarily focus on semantic relevance often discard tokens that are crucial for spatial reasoning. We address this gap through a novel insight into \\emph{how LVLMs process spatial reasoning}. Specifically, we reveal that LVLMs implicitly establish visual coordinate systems through Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), where specific token positions serve as \\textbf{implicit visual coordinates} (IVC tokens) that are essential for spatial reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{IVC-Prune}, a training-free, prompt-aware pruning strategy that retains both IVC tokens and semantically relevant foreground tokens. IVC tokens are identified by theoretically analyzing the mathematical properties of RoPE, targeting positions at which its rotation matrices approximate identity matrix or the $90^\\circ$ rotation matrix. Foreground tokens are identified through a robust two-stage process: semantic seed discovery followed by contextual refinement via value-vector similarity. Extensive evaluations across four representative LVLMs and twenty diverse benchmarks show that IVC-Prune reduces visual tokens by approximately 50\\% while maintaining $\\geq$ 99\\% of the original performance and even achieving improvements on several benchmarks.

Prediction models forecast surrounding agent motion under unknown intentions, producing multimodal distributions, while planning assumes known ego objectives and generates deterministic trajectories. This mismatch creates a critical bottleneck: prediction lacks supervision for agent intentions, while planning requires this information. Existing prediction models, despite strong benchmarking performance, often remain disconnected from planning constraints such as collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility. We introduce Plan TRansformer (PTR), a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework integrating goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. A teacher-student training strategy progressively masks surrounding agent commands during training to align with inference conditions where agent intentions are unavailable. PTR achieves 4.3%/3.5% improvement in marginal/joint mAP compared to the baseline Motion Transformer (MTR) and 15.5% planning error reduction at 5s horizon compared to GameFormer.

Recent approaches tackle this task by utilizing Gaussian-based temporal proposals to represent query-relevant segments. However, their inference strategies rely on heuristic mappings from Gaussian parameters to segment boundaries, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a novel inference framework that predicts segment boundaries by solving a principled optimization problem that balances proposal coverage and segment compactness. We derive a closed-form solution for this problem and rigorously analyze the optimality conditions under varying penalty regimes. Beyond its theoretical foundations, GBO offers several practical advantages: it is training-free and compatible with both single-Gaussian and mixture-based proposal architectures. Our experiments show that GBO significantly improves localization, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of GBO across various proposal schemes.

Here, we present SKELEX, a large-scale foundation model for musculoskeletal radiographs, trained using self-supervised learning on 1.2 million diverse, condition-rich images. The model was evaluated on 12 downstream diagnostic tasks and generally outperformed baselines in fracture detection, osteoarthritis grading, and bone tumor classification. Furthermore, SKELEX demonstrated zero-shot abnormality localization, producing error maps that identified pathologic regions without task-specific training. Building on this capability, we developed an interpretable, region-guided model for predicting bone tumors, which maintained robust performance on independent external datasets and was deployed as a publicly accessible web application.

The optimization performance largely depends on the quality of initial trajectories. However, the selection of a high-quality initial trajectory is non-trivial and requires a considerable time budget due to the extremely large space of the solution trajectories and the lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space. To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations.

With recent large-scale foundation models showing strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks including classification and segmentation, there has been interest in using the internal feature maps of these models for the semantic correspondence task. Recent works observe that features from DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion (SD) are complementary, the former producing accurate but sparse correspondences, while the latter produces spatially consistent correspondences. As a result, current state-of-the-art methods for semantic correspondence involve combining features from both models in an ensemble. While the performance of these methods is impressive, they are computationally expensive, requiring evaluating feature maps from large-scale foundation models. In this work we take a different approach, instead replacing SD features with a superior matching algorithm which is imbued with the desirable spatial consistency property. Specifically, we replace the standard nearest neighbours matching with an optimal transport algorithm that includes a Gromov Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior. We show that we can significantly boost the performance of the DINOv2 baseline, and be competitive and sometimes surpassing state-of-the-art methods using Stable Diffusion features, while being 5--10x more efficient.

However, developing proactive agents is hindered by the lack of specialized resources. To address this, we introduce ProAct-75, a benchmark designed to train and evaluate proactive agents across diverse domains, including assistance, maintenance, and safety monitoring. Spanning 75 tasks, our dataset features 91,581 step-level annotations enriched with explicit task graphs. These graphs encode step dependencies and parallel execution possibilities, providing the structural grounding necessary for complex decision-making. Building on this benchmark, we propose ProAct-Helper, a reference baseline powered by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that grounds decision-making in state detection, and leveraging task graphs to enable entropy-driven heuristic search for action selection, allowing agents to execute parallel threads independently rather than mirroring the human's next step.

Recent advances in generative models, such as conditional diffusion and few-shot NeRFs, offer a new paradigm for data augmentation by synthesizing data with significantly greater diversity and realism. However, unlike traditional augmentations like cropping or rotation, these methods introduce substantial changes that enhance robustness but also risk degrading performance if the augmentations are poorly matched to the task. In this work, we present EvoAug, an automated augmentation learning pipeline, which leverages these generative models alongside an efficient evolutionary algorithm to learn optimal task-specific augmentations. Our pipeline introduces a novel approach to image augmentation that learns stochastic augmentation trees that hierarchically compose augmentations, enabling more structured and adaptive transformations.

While most existing methods focus on quasi-static behaviors, dynamic tasks such as swing-up require accurate exploitation of continuum dynamics. This has led to studies on simple low-order template systems that often fail to capture the complexity of real continuum deformations. Model-based optimal control offers a systematic solution; however, its application to rigid-soft robots is often limited by the computational cost and inaccuracy of numerical differentiation for high-dimensional models. Building on recent advances in the Geometric Variable Strain model that enable analytical derivatives, this work investigates three optimal control strategies for underactuated soft systems-Direct Collocation, Differential Dynamic Programming, and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-to perform dynamic swing-up tasks. To address stiff continuum dynamics and constrained actuation, implicit integration schemes and warm-start strategies are employed to improve numerical robustness and computational efficiency. The methods are evaluated in simulation on three Rigid-Soft and high-order soft benchmark systems-the Soft Cart-Pole, the Soft Pendubot, and the Soft Furuta Pendulum- highlighting their performance and computational trade-offs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u914d\u70b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5fae\u5206\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u5728\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u6001\u6446\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u521a-\u8f6f\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u522b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6446\u52a8\uff09\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u521a-\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65f6\u53d7\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5fae\u5206\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u53d8\u5e94\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff08\u652f\u6301\u89e3\u6790\u5bfc\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u914d\u70b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5fae\u5206\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u521a\u6027\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u503c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u521a-\u8f6f\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u8f6f\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u8f6f\u4f53\u5c0f\u8f66-\u6746\u3001\u8f6f\u4f53\u53cc\u6446\u3001\u8f6f\u4f53Furuta\u6446\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u53d8\u5e94\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5bfc\u6570\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u521a-\u8f6f\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

HetroD targets the critical challenge of navi- gating real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulner- able road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists that interact with vehicles. These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

Because of these challenges the task is underdetermined, where there exists multiple -- possibly infinite -- poses that are plausible given the image. Despite this, many prior works assume the existence of a deterministic mapping and estimate a single pose given an image. Furthermore, methods based on machine learning require a large amount of paired 2D-3D data to train and suffer from generalization issues to unseen scenarios. To address both of these issues, we propose a framework for pose estimation using diffusion models, which enables sampling from a probability distribution over plausible poses which are consistent with a 2D image. Our approach falls under the guidance framework for conditional generation, and guides samples from an unconditional diffusion model, trained only on 3D data, using the gradients of the heatmaps from a 2D keypoint detector. We evaluate our method on the Human 3.6M dataset under best-of-$m$ multiple hypothesis evaluation, showing state-of-the-art performance among methods which do not require paired 2D-3D data for training. We additionally evaluate the generalization ability using the MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW datasets and demonstrate competitive performance. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by using it for novel tasks including pose generation and pose completion, without the need to train bespoke conditional models.

While perception information, such as height map, enhances terrain awareness, sensor noise and sim-to-real gaps can destabilize policies in practice. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis that bounds the return gap under observation noise, when the induced latent dynamics are contractive. Furthermore, we present Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework that maps high-dimensional, disturbance-prone observations into a latent space, where local perturbations are attenuated over time. Specifically, this approach couples contrastive representation learning with Lipschitz regularization to preserve task-relevant geometry while explicitly controlling sensitivity. Notably, the formulation can be incorporated into modern deep reinforcement learning pipelines as an auxiliary loss term with minimal additional technical effort required.

As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience.

These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics.

While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers. Experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "SwiftVLM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\"\u65c1\u8def\"\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u7559\u672a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u65e9\u671f\u526a\u679d\u9020\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u6c38\u4e45\u4e22\u5931\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6d45\u5c42\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u5c42\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u65c1\u8def\"\u526a\u679d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u672a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f20\u9012\u5230\u540e\u7eed\u526a\u679d\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002SwiftVLM\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u8de8\u5c42\u72ec\u7acb\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSwiftVLM\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u9009\u62e9\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "SwiftVLM\u901a\u8fc7\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u65e9\u526a\u679d\u9020\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

One challenge lies in addressing interaction-awareness. Most existing approaches oversimplify interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents, and often neglect interactions among the agents themselves. A common solution is to model these interactions using classical game theory. However, its formulation assumes rational players, whereas human behavior is frequently uncertain or irrational. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum Game Decision-Making (QGDM) model, a novel framework that combines classical game theory with quantum mechanics principles (such as superposition, entanglement, and interference) to tackle multi-player, multi-strategy decision-making problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to apply quantum game theory to decision-making for automated driving. QGDM runs in real time on a standard computer, without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate QGDM in simulation across various scenarios, including roundabouts, merging, and highways, and compare its performance with multiple baseline methods.

Despite advancements in autonomy, these robots often struggle to perform reliably in dynamic and unstructured environments and require human intervention to recover from failures. Effective human-robot collaboration is essential to enable robots to receive assistance from the most competent operator, in order to reduce their workload and minimize disruptions in task execution. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for allocating robotic failures to human operators (ARFA). Our proposed approach models the capabilities of human operators, and continuously updates these beliefs based on their actual performance for failure recovery. For every failure to be resolved, a reward function calculates expected outcomes based on operator capabilities and historical data, task urgency, and current workload distribution. The failure is then assigned to the operator with the highest expected reward. Our simulations and user studies show that ARFA outperforms random allocation, significantly reducing robot idle time, improving overall system performance, and leading to a more distributed workload among operators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6545\u969c\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ARFA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7d27\u6025\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5c06\u6545\u969c\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u9884\u671f\u6536\u76ca\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u5668\u548c\u4eba\u5f62\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u65b0\u51a0\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u88ab\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u62a4\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u6765\u4ece\u6545\u969c\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u3002\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ece\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u83b7\u5f97\u534f\u52a9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6545\u969c\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ARFA\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u8868\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff1b3\uff09\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6545\u969c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7d27\u6025\u6027\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\uff1b4\uff09\u5c06\u6545\u969c\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u9884\u671f\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cARFA\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "ARFA\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6545\u969c\u7ed9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy.

Video: https://youtu.be/lgX2J-00TRM", "summary": "We address dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects by presenting SPiD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework that couples an accurate deformable object model with an augmented self-supervised training strategy. On the modeling side, we extend a mass-spring model to more accurately capture object dynamics while remaining lightweight enough for high-throughput rollouts during self-supervised learning. On the learning side, we train a neural controller using a task-oriented cost, enabling end-to-end optimization through interaction with the differentiable object model. In addition, we propose a self-supervised DAgger variant that detects distribution shift during deployment and performs offline self-correction to further enhance robustness without expert supervision. We evaluate our method primarily on the rope stabilization task, where a robot must bring a swinging rope to rest as quickly and smoothly as possible. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves fast and smooth rope stabilization, generalizing across unseen initial states, rope lengths, masses, non-uniform mass distributions, and external disturbances. Additionally, we develop an affordable markerless rope perception method and demonstrate that our controller maintains performance with noisy and low-frequency state updates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the framework by extending it to the rope trajectory tracking task.

This human-in-the-loop adaptation is employed in a group-activity video retrieval framework to improve its retrieval performance. Our method initially pre-trains the GAF space based on the similarity of group activities in a self-supervised manner, unlike prior work that classifies videos into pre-defined group activity classes in a supervised learning manner. Our interactive fine-tuning process updates the GAF space to allow a user to better retrieve videos similar to query videos given by the user. In this fine-tuning, our proposed data-efficient video selection process provides several videos, which are selected from a video database, to the user in order to manually label these videos as positive or negative. These labeled videos are used to update (i.e., fine-tune) the GAF space, so that the positive and negative videos move closer to and farther away from the query videos through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive experimental results on two team sports datasets validate that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance. Ablation studies also demonstrate that several components in our human-in-the-loop adaptation contribute to the improvement of the retrieval performance.

To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid variance-reduced MPPI framework that integrates a prior model into the sampling process. Our key insight is to decompose the objective function into a known approximate model and a residual term. Since the residual captures only the discrepancy between the model and the objective, it typically exhibits a smaller magnitude and lower variance than the original objective. Although this principle applies to general modeling choices, we demonstrate that adopting a quadratic approximation enables the derivation of a closed-form, model-guided prior that effectively concentrates samples in informative regions. Crucially, the framework is agnostic to the source of geometric information, allowing the quadratic model to be constructed from exact derivatives, structural approximations (e.g., Gauss- or Quasi-Newton), or gradient-free randomized smoothing. We validate the approach on standard optimization benchmarks, a nonlinear, underactuated cart-pole control task, and a contact-rich manipulation problem with non-smooth dynamics. Across these domains, we achieve faster convergence and superior performance in low-sample regimes compared to standard MPPI. These results suggest that the method can make sample-based control strategies more practical in scenarios where obtaining samples is expensive or limited.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cfMPPI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5df2\u77e5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u9879\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08\u5982MPPI\uff09\u867d\u7136\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cfMPPI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5df2\u77e5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u9879\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u6b21\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u6837\u672c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u6570\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6216\u68af\u5ea6\u81ea\u7531\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u6ed1\u6784\u5efa\u4e8c\u6b21\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u5012\u7acb\u6446\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u64cd\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6MPPI\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u548c\u5728\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u6602\u8d35\u6216\u6709\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387"}}

Nevertheless, the substantial model size and high computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) limit downstream applications. While low-bit quantization is a common approach for model compression, the effectiveness of quantized models is challenged by the high dynamic range of input latent and diverse layer behaviors. To deal with these challenges, we introduce LSGQuant, a layer-sensitivity guided quantizing approach for one-step diffusion-based real-world VSR. Our method incorporates a Dynamic Range Adaptive Quantizer (DRAQ) to fit video token activations. Furthermore, we estimate layer sensitivity and implement a Variance-Oriented Layer Training Strategy (VOLTS) by analyzing layer-wise statistics in calibration. We also introduce Quantization-Aware Optimization (QAO) to jointly refine the quantized branch and a retained high-precision branch.

Most existing approaches decouple perception from representation, treating the scene graph as a derivative layer generated post hoc. This limits both consistency and scalability. In contrast, we propose a mapping architecture where the 3DSSG serves as the foundational backend, acting as the primary knowledge representation for the entire mapping process.\n  Our approach leverages prior work on incremental scene graph prediction to infer and update the graph structure in real-time as the environment is explored. This ensures that the map remains topologically consistent and computationally efficient, even during extended operations in large-scale settings. By maintaining an explicit, spatially grounded representation that supports both flat and hierarchical topologies, we bridge the gap between sub-symbolic raw sensor data and high-level symbolic reasoning.

However, existing regression-based approaches are prone to dynamic or ambiguous scenarios, as they either solely rely on single-frame inference or neglect the spatio-temporal consistency across scans. In this paper, we propose TempLoc, a new LiDAR relocalization framework that enhances the robustness of localization by effectively modeling sequential consistency. Specifically, a Global Coordinate Estimation module is first introduced to predict point-wise global coordinates and associated uncertainties for each LiDAR scan. A Prior Coordinate Generation module is then presented to estimate inter-frame point correspondences by the attention mechanism.

However, they still face key challenges: a misalignment between coordinate-space actions and pixel-space videos, sensitivity to camera viewpoint, and non-unified architectures across embodiments. To this end, we present BridgeV2W, which converts coordinate-space actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks rendered from the URDF and camera parameters. These masks are then injected into a pretrained video generation model via a ControlNet-style pathway, which aligns the action control signals with predicted videos, adds view-specific conditioning to accommodate camera viewpoints, and yields a unified world model architecture across embodiments. To mitigate overfitting to static backgrounds, BridgeV2W further introduces a flow-based motion loss that focuses on learning dynamic and task-relevant regions. Experiments on single-arm (DROID) and dual-arm (AgiBot-G1) datasets, covering diverse and challenging conditions with unseen viewpoints and scenes, show that BridgeV2W improves video generation quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the potential of BridgeV2W on downstream real-world tasks, including policy evaluation and goal-conditioned planning.

However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6982\u7387\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u5df2\u77e5\u6216\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u6216\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u83b7\u5f97\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u5171\u5f62\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u5185\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540d\u4e49\u5956\u52b1\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u57df", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u5012\u7acb\u6446\u3001\u8f66\u9053\u8ddf\u968f\u3001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u6240\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u7387\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4"}}

Although world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving data, they often suffer from identity drift, where the same object changes its appearance or category across frames due to the absence of instance-level temporal constraints. We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity.

Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware.

When adapted to vision transformers, the standard axial formulation decomposes two-dimensional spatial positions into horizontal and vertical components, implicitly restricting positional encoding to axis-aligned directions. We identify this directional constraint as a fundamental limitation of the standard axial 2D RoPE, which hinders the modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spiral RoPE, a simple yet effective extension that enables multi-directional positional encoding by partitioning embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of the patch position onto its corresponding direction, allowing spatial relationships to be encoded beyond the horizontal and vertical axes.

In this paper, we propose EventFlash, a novel and efficient MLLM to explore spatiotemporal token sparsification for reducing data redundancy and accelerating inference. Technically, we build EventMind, a large-scale and scene-diverse dataset with over 500k instruction sets, providing both short and long event stream sequences to support our curriculum training strategy. We then present an adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, which adaptively compresses temporal tokens while retaining key temporal cues. Finally, a sparse density-guided attention module is designed to improve spatial token efficiency by selecting informative regions and suppressing empty or sparse areas. Experimental results show that EventFlash achieves a $12.4\\times$ throughput improvement over the baseline (EventFlash-Zero) while maintaining comparable performance.

By incorporating these instance-aware mechanisms, InstaDrive achieves state-of-the-art video generation quality and enhances downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

Furthermore, standard systems cannot perform \"blind\" localization from verbal descriptions alone, a capability needed for applications such as emergency response. To address these challenges, we introduce LaVPR, a large-scale benchmark that extends existing VPR datasets with over 650,000 rich natural-language descriptions. Using LaVPR, we investigate two paradigms: Multi-Modal Fusion for enhanced robustness and Cross-Modal Retrieval for language-based localization. Our results show that language descriptions yield consistent gains in visually degraded conditions, with the most significant impact on smaller backbones. Notably, adding language allows compact models to rival the performance of much larger vision-only architectures. For cross-modal retrieval, we establish a baseline using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Multi-Similarity loss, which substantially outperforms standard contrastive methods across vision-language models. Ultimately, LaVPR enables a new class of localization systems that are both resilient to real-world stochasticity and practical for resource-constrained deployment.

Among existing TTA strategies, pseudo-label-based methods have shown promising performance. However, they often rely on perturbation-ensemble heuristics (e.g., dropout sampling, test-time augmentation, Gaussian noise), which lack distributional grounding and yield unstable training signals. This can trigger error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. To address this, we propose \\textbf{A3-TTA}, a TTA framework that constructs reliable pseudo-labels through anchor-guided supervision. Specifically, we identify well-predicted target domain images using a class compact density metric, under the assumption that confident predictions imply distributional proximity to the source domain. These anchors serve as stable references to guide pseudo-label generation, which is further regularized via semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization. Additionally, we introduce a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to mitigate label noise and stabilize model update during adaptation. Evaluated on both multi-domain medical images (heart structure and prostate segmentation) and natural images, A3-TTA significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points compared to the source model, outperforming several state-of-the-art TTA methods under different segmentation model architectures. A3-TTA also excels in continual TTA, maintaining high performance across sequential target domains with strong anti-forgetting ability.

At the same time, in practical applications, generative data augmentation can be vulnerable to clean-label backdoor attacks, which aim to bypass human inspection. However, based on theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments, we observe that directly applying existing pixel-level clean-label backdoor attack methods (e.g., COMBAT) to generated images results in low attack success rates. This motivates us to move beyond pixel-level triggers and focus instead on the latent feature level. To this end, we propose InvLBA, an invisible clean-label backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation by latent perturbation. We theoretically prove that the generalization of the clean accuracy and attack success rates of InvLBA can be guaranteed.

Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization.

Current defensive approaches remain cumbersome, often requiring invasive model modifications, expensive training procedures or auxiliary data access. To address these threats, in this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and non-invasive defense mechanism in the spectral domain, grounded in a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between imperceptible perturbations and high-frequency spectral components. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel purification framework, termed PWAVEP, which begins by computing a spectral graph wavelet domain saliency score and local sparsity score for each point. Guided by these values, PWAVEP adopts a hierarchical strategy, it eliminates the most salient points, which are identified as hardly recoverable adversarial outliers. Simultaneously, it applies a spectral filtering process to a broader set of moderately salient points. This process leverages a graph wavelet transform to attenuate high-frequency coefficients associated with the targeted points, thereby effectively suppressing adversarial noise. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PWAVEP achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud purification.

CompTok uses a token-conditioned diffusion decoder. By employing an InfoGAN-style objective, where we train a recognition model to predict the tokens used to condition the diffusion decoder using the decoded images, we enforce the decoder to not ignore any of the tokens. To promote compositional control, besides the original images, CompTok also trains on tokens formed by swapping token subsets between images, enabling more compositional control of the token over the decoder. As the swapped tokens between images do not have ground truth image targets, we apply a manifold constraint via an adversarial flow regularizer to keep unpaired swap generations on the natural-image distribution. The resulting tokenizer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on image class-conditioned generation, but also demonstrates properties such as swapping tokens between images to achieve high level semantic editing of an image. Additionally, we propose two metrics that measures the landscape of the token space that can be useful to describe not only the compositionality of the tokens, but also how easy to learn the landscape is for a generator to be trained on this space. We show in experiments that CompTok can improve on both of the metrics as well as supporting state-of-the-art generators for class conditioned generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CompTok\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7token\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548cInfoGAN\u98ce\u683c\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u589e\u5f3atoken\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362token\u5b50\u96c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0ctoken\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7token\u4ea4\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3atoken\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6240\u6709token\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528token\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528InfoGAN\u98ce\u683c\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7528\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684token\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e0d\u5ffd\u7565\u4efb\u4f55token\uff1b3. \u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4token\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec4\u5408\u63a7\u5236\uff1b4. \u5bf9\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2. \u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362token\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u663e\u793aCompTok\u5728token\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b4. \u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "CompTok\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5229\u7528\u6240\u6709token\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Although significant progress has been made in existing methods, their optimization rely solely on the supervision from voxel labels and face the challenge of voxel sparsity as a large portion of voxels in autonomous driving scenarios are empty, which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance. To address this issue, we propose a \\textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions.

As an internal baseline, we include the canonical DDPM-style objective ($\u03b5$-prediction with $L_2$ loss) and isolate the effect of prediction parameterization and $L_p$ geometry under a matched setup. Experiments show that $x_0$-prediction is consistently the strongest choice for joint synthesis, and that fractional sub-quadratic penalties ($L_{1.5}$) improve image fidelity while $L_2$ better preserves lesion mask morphology.

We propose DiM, a new multi-dimensional watermarking framework that formulates watermarking as a dimension-aware mapping problem, thereby unifying existing watermarking methods at the functional level. Under DiM, watermark information is modeled as payloads of different dimensionalities, including one-dimensional binary messages, two-dimensional spatial masks, and three-dimensional spatiotemporal structures. We find that the dimensional configuration of embedding and extraction largely determines the resulting watermarking behavior.

However, their reliance on reconstruction-based training creates a fundamental conflict between the sharp, high-frequency attention maps of the encoder and the spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps of the decoder. We identify that this discrepancy gives rise to a vicious cycle: the noisy feature map from the encoder forces the decoder to average over possibilities and produce even blurrier outputs, while the gradient computed from blurry reconstruction maps lacks high-frequency details necessary to supervise encoder features. To break this cycle, we introduce Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) that establishes a virtuous cycle where the encoder and decoder mutually refine one another. SRL leverages the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary within the decoder output, while exploiting the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise the encoder's features. This mutual refinement process is stabilized by a warm-up phase with a slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot. By bridging the representational gap between the encoder and decoder, SRL achieves state-of-the-art results on video object-centric learning benchmarks.

However, they often introduce visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment. This work preliminarily explores why visual hallucinations arise and how to reduce them. We first investigate RFT methods from a unified perspective, and reveal the core problems stemming from two aspects, exploration and exploitation: (1) limited exploration during stochastic differential equation (SDE) rollouts, leading to an over-emphasis on local details at the expense of global semantics, and (2) trajectory imitation process inherent in policy gradient methods, distorting the model's foundational vector field and its cross-step consistency. Building on this, we propose ConsistentRFT, a general framework to mitigate these hallucinations. Specifically, we design a Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism to balance exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources. We then introduce a Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves the model's consistency by aligning the current policy with a more stable prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistentRFT significantly mitigates visual hallucinations, achieving average reductions of 49\\% for low-level and 38\\% for high-level perceptual hallucinations. Furthermore, ConsistentRFT outperforms other RFT methods on out-of-domain metrics, showing an improvement of 5.1\\% (v.s. the baseline's decrease of -0.4\\%) over FLUX1.dev.

At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues. At the appearance level, we integrate the VLM-derived correspondences into a correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This module restricts each text token to attend only to its matched reference regions, ensuring precise attribute binding and reliable multi-subject composition.

However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples.

To tackle LAC, we propose LogiCls, a vision-language framework that decomposes complex logical constraints into a sequence of verifiable subqueries. We further present a data-centric instruction synthesis pipeline that generates chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision for these subqueries, coupling precise grounding annotations with diverse image-text augmentations to adapt vision language models (VLMs) to logic-sensitive reasoning. Training is stabilized by a difficulty-aware resampling strategy that emphasizes challenging subqueries and long tail constraint types.

Project page: https://cyw-3d.github.io/PnP-U3D/", "summary": "The rapid progress of large multimodal models has inspired efforts toward unified frameworks that couple understanding and generation. While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation. A lightweight transformer bridges the feature space of large language models and the conditional space of 3D diffusion models, enabling effective cross-modal information exchange while preserving the priors learned by standalone models.

In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDGS delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits, achieving over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "CDGS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u9884\u7b97\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf4D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b03\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u57284D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u90e8\u7f72\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u8fc7\u5927\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u800c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u5728\u9884\u8bbe\u9ad8\u65af\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCDGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u9884\u7b97\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\u878d\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b\u89e3\u8026\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5143\u7d20\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "CDGS\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u8bef\u5dee<2%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u901f\u7387-\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc73\u500d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "conclusion": "CDGS\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58-\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf4D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

Recently, deep learning (DL) based segmentation models have shown the capacity to accomplish such a task. However, the training of the segmentation networks requires large amount of data with manual annotations, which is a major concern due to the data scarcity from clinic. Working with limited data is still common for researches on novel imaging modalities. To enhance the effectiveness of DL models trained with limited data, data augmentation (DA) is a crucial regularization technique. Traditional DA (TDA) strategies focus on basic intra-image operations, i.e. generating images with different orientations and intensity distributions. In contrast, the interimage and object-level DA operations are able to create new images from separate individuals. However, such DA strategies are not well explored on the task of multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we investigated four possible inter-image DA strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug and AnatoMix, on two organ segmentation datasets. The result shows that CutMix, CarveMix and AnatoMix can improve the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0 and 1.9, compared with the state-of-the-art nnUNet without DA strategies. These results can be further improved by adding TDA strategies. It is revealed in our experiments that Cut-Mix is a robust but simple DA strategy to drive up the segmentation performance for multi-organ segmentation, even when CutMix produces intuitively 'wrong' images.

To address this, we present ELIQ, a Label-free Framework for Quality Assessment of Evolving AI-generated Images. Specifically, ELIQ focuses on visual quality and prompt-image alignment, automatically constructs positive and aspect-specific negative pairs to cover both conventional distortions and AIGC-specific distortion modes, enabling transferable supervision without human annotations. Building on these pairs, ELIQ adapts a pre-trained multimodal model into a quality-aware critic via instruction tuning and predicts two-dimensional quality using lightweight gated fusion and a Quality Query Transformer. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ELIQ consistently outperforms existing label-free methods, generalizes from AI-generated content (AIGC) to user-generated content (UGC) scenarios without modification, and paves the way for scalable and label-free quality assessment under continuously evolving generative models.

However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simultaneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information (i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks.

Existing methods often struggle with topological fragmentation of slender creatures in the deep sea and the subtle feature extraction of transparent organisms.

To address physical degradation, we design the Water-Conditioned Adaptive Perceptor (WCAP), which employs Riemannian metric tensors to dynamically deform convolutional sampling fields. Furthermore, the Abyssal-Topology Refinement Module (ATRM) is developed to maintain the structural connectivity of spindly targets through skeletal priors.

Current methods mainly rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, this paradigm suffers from heavy data dependence and limited scalability against the rapid evolution of MLLMs. Although recent zero-shot approaches offer a flexible alternative, their performance remains significantly behind SFT-based methods, due to the straightforward workflow designs. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Refer-Agent}, a collaborative multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection mechanisms. This system decomposes RVOS into step-by-step reasoning process. During reasoning, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine frame selection strategy to ensure the frame diversity and textual relevance, along with a Dynamic Focus Layout that adaptively adjusts the agent's visual focus. Furthermore, we propose a Chain-of-Reflection mechanism, which employs a Questioner-Responder pair to generate a self-reflection chain, enabling the system to verify intermediate results and generates feedback for next-round reasoning refinement.

JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse.

However, this paradigm often suffers from severe visual redundancy and high computational overhead, especially when processing long videos. Crucially, existing keyframe selection strategies, especially those based on CLIP similarity, are prone to biases and may inadvertently overlook critical frames, resulting in suboptimal video comprehension. To address these significant challenges, we propose \\textbf{KTV}, a novel two-stage framework for efficient and effective training-free video understanding. In the first stage, KTV performs question-agnostic keyframe selection by clustering frame-level visual features, yielding a compact, diverse, and representative subset of frames that mitigates temporal redundancy. In the second stage, KTV applies key visual token selection, pruning redundant or less informative tokens from each selected keyframe based on token importance and redundancy, which significantly reduces the number of tokens fed into the LLM. Extensive experiments on the Multiple-Choice VideoQA task demonstrate that KTV outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines while using significantly fewer visual tokens, \\emph{e.g.}, only 504 visual tokens for a 60-min video with 10800 frames, achieving $44.8\\%$ accuracy on the MLVU-Test benchmark.

However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks.

This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions. (3) We propose a unique sparse partitioning approach, ensuring equal treatment for each category. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and DIOR datasets show that our framework achieves a significant performance gain over traditional oriented object detection methods mentioned above, offering a highly cost-effective solution.

Both suffer from the \"One Anomaly Class, One Model\" limitation. To address this, we propose Referring Industrial Anomaly Segmentation (RIAS), a paradigm leveraging language to guide detection. RIAS generates precise masks from text descriptions without manual thresholds and uses universal prompts to detect diverse anomalies with a single model. We introduce the MVTec-Ref dataset to support this, designed with diverse referring expressions and focusing on anomaly patterns, notably with 95% small anomalies. We also propose the Dual Query Token with Mask Group Transformer (DQFormer) benchmark, enhanced by Language-Gated Multi-Level Aggregation (LMA) to improve multi-scale segmentation. Unlike traditional methods using redundant queries, DQFormer employs only \"Anomaly\" and \"Background\" tokens for efficient visual-textual integration. Experiments demonstrate RIAS's effectiveness in advancing IAD toward open-set capabilities.

To address this limitation, we introduce a new multi-round visual reasoning benchmark with training and test sets spanning both detection and segmentation tasks, enabling systematic evaluation under iterative reasoning scenarios. We further propose RegionReasoner, a reinforcement learning framework that enforces grounded reasoning by requiring each reasoning trace to explicitly cite the corresponding reference bounding boxes, while maintaining semantic coherence via a global-local consistency reward. This reward extracts key objects and nouns from both global scene captions and region-level captions, aligning them with the reasoning trace to ensure consistency across reasoning steps. RegionReasoner is optimized with structured rewards combining grounding fidelity and global-local semantic alignment.

Although robotic platforms equipped with visual sensors can efficiently detect structural deficiencies, the automated generation of human-readable summaries from these detections remains a significant challenge, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline for end-to-end summarization of underground deficiencies, combining our lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployed on an edge computing platform. The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. We deploy and evaluate our complete pipeline on a mobile robotic platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world inspection scenarios.

While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state.

Current professional workflows require tedious manual segmentation and the artistic ``hallucination'' of occluded regions to enable motion. Our approach overcomes this by decomposing a single image into fully inpainted, semantically distinct layers with inferred drawing orders. To address the scarcity of training data, we introduce a scalable engine that bootstraps high-quality supervision from commercial Live2D models, capturing pixel-perfect semantics and hidden geometry. Our methodology couples a diffusion-based Body Part Consistency Module, which enforces global geometric coherence, with a pixel-level pseudo-depth inference mechanism. This combination resolves the intricate stratification of anime characters, e.g., interleaving hair strands, allowing for dynamic layer reconstruction.

We introduce Representation-Aligned Guidance (REPA-G), a framework that leverages these aligned representations, with rich semantic properties, to enable test-time conditioning from features in generation. By optimizing a similarity objective (the potential) at inference, we steer the denoising process toward a conditioned representation extracted from a pre-trained feature extractor. Our method provides versatile control at multiple scales, ranging from fine-grained texture matching via single patches to broad semantic guidance using global image feature tokens. We further extend this to multi-concept composition, allowing for the faithful combination of distinct concepts. REPA-G operates entirely at inference time, offering a flexible and precise alternative to often ambiguous text prompts or coarse class labels. We theoretically justify how this guidance enables sampling from the potential-induced tilted distribution.

RAW images preserve unprocessed scene data, enabling models to leverage richer cues for both object detection and object description, capturing fine-grained details, spatial relationships, and contextual information often lost in processed images. To support research in this domain, we introduce RAWDet-7, a large-scale dataset of ~25k training and 7.6k test RAW images collected across diverse cameras, lighting conditions, and environments, densely annotated for seven object categories following MS-COCO and LVIS conventions.

In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision.

However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients.

Some recent works have addressed this by conditioning between scales in a multiscale pyramid. Others have looked at parallelizing samples in a single image using regular partitions or randomized orders. In this work we examine a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. Our ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step.

Existing efforts in efficient training focus on reducing model sizes or trainable parameters. Inspired by the success of Visual Token Pruning (VTP) in improving inference efficiency, we are exploring another substantial research direction for efficient training by reducing visual tokens. However, applying VTP at the training stage results in a training-inference mismatch: pruning-trained models perform poorly when inferring on non-pruned full visual token sequences. To close this gap, we propose DualSpeed, a fast-slow framework for efficient training of MLLMs. The fast-mode is the primary mode, which incorporates existing VTP methods as plugins to reduce visual tokens, along with a mode isolator to isolate the model's behaviors. The slow-mode is the auxiliary mode, where the model is trained on full visual sequences to retain training-inference consistency. To boost its training, it further leverages self-distillation to learn from the sufficiently trained fast-mode. Together, DualSpeed can achieve both training efficiency and non-degraded performance. Experiments show DualSpeed accelerates the training of LLaVA-1.5 by 2.1$\\times$ and LLaVA-NeXT by 4.0$\\times$, retaining over 99% performance.

However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches.

Our approach, for the first time, combines 3D signed distance function and density field learning with event-based supervision. Furthermore, we introduce spherical harmonics encodings into our model for enhanced handling of view-dependent effects. EventNeuS outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin, achieving 34% lower Chamfer distance and 31% lower mean absolute error on average compared to the best previous method.", "AI": {"tldr": "EventNeuS\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408SDF\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u5f69\u8272\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e603D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eRGB\u76f8\u673a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e25\u91cd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c63D\u7f51\u683c\u91cd\u5efa\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u7ed3\u54083D\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7403\u8c10\u51fd\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u5f69\u8272\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u5b66\u4e603D\u8868\u793a", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e34%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e31%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "EventNeuS\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u5c06SDF\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76d1\u7763\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a3D\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6"}}
